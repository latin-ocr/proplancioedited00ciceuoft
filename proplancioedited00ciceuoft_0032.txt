xxviii CICERO'S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

devoted admirer Boissier 1 can say ‘ quoiqu'il s'adresse
au fidele Atticus on croit entendre un echo des harangues
solennelles qu'il vient de prononcer au senat et devant le

a lack of passion, a thinly varnished superficiality and
heartlessness‚ which could not but be incompatible with
genuine friendship and truth of intercourse.2

to by the fact that within fifteen years no less than seven
laws were passed to check corrupt practices at electioris,
The young nobles were crowding to take up a political
career, not from any patriotic motives, but to recoup their
shattered fortunes by gaining such office as would give
them a province to plunder.3 Nor had the provinces

¹ much chance of redress: provinciae populatae vexatae
funditus eversae socii stipendiariique populi Romani
