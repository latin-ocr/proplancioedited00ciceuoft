(cf. ἐξ 11, 27, Introd. ἓ 7) being present in court.

23. in me custodiendum: cf. Introd. ξ 12.

ξ 62 1. 24. secundum: Plancius possesses neither the first
advantage, to be disertus, nor the second, to think himself such.

32 1. quasi: cf. ξ 61, to correct a false impression.

3. professi sunt: i.e. ‘those accomplishments,' istius modi
artes.

340), its meanings seem to have been ‘ for food ’-> ‘ for service'
-> ‘useful' —J ‘honest’ For a similar predicative dative cf.
