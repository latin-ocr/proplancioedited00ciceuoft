10. haec habes, ‘ these are not the pleas you make use of,’
‘ this is not your view of the conduct of the case.' habes is here
used loosely, as Kopke shows ; it is to a certain extent parallel
to in causa habere (cf. Rosc. Am. ξ 91 haberet in causa)= ‘to
have on one’s side,’ e. g. aryumenta, but there is no doubt that
in some way it picks up the preceding habebas ‘considen’
Οίῑῗῖῗὲ editors take it as simply=scire‚ which spoils the sense of
con is.

13. fautores: sc. sicnt=favent; words in -tor and -trioe
always denote those who do something habitually or for some
permanent object. Thus of functionaries‚ dictator, quaestor ;
of artisans, fictor sculptor, institor retail dealer, mercator
wholesale merchant, structor mason ; of people who are always
showing some distinguishing quality or defect, calumniator,
ratiocinator ; of those who have performed a seat so remarkable
as to confer on them a durable characteristic, creator urbis
(Romulus), servator Graeciae (Themistocles), Cimbrorum victor
(Marius) 3 cf. Meissner Latin Phrase-book p. 143 note.

5561. 20. more meo pristino: by a false assumption of
modesty Cicero shirks the most difficult part of his task, the
examining of the evidence, Schol. vat. Cicero describes his
usual method of dealing with evidence in Part. Or. ἓ 49, where he
states that an orator should begin by saying that the evidence
is not to the point, then compare other cases and show instances
where evidence has turned out to be false, then blacken the
character of the witness by every possible means and try and
show that he has some motive for giving false evidence.

21. non quo sit . . sed. quia est: the subjunctive,
according to Roby (ξ 1744), is used of a reported or assumed
reason, the indicative of the genuine or most probable reason ;

’ “ ef. puqiles . . inqemiscunt . . non quod doleant . . sed quia . .

 

omne corpus intenditur, Tusc. Disp. 2. 233 but occasionally
post-Ciceronian writers have indicative with non quia of false
reasons, Hor. Sat. 2. 2. 89 rancidum aprum antiqui laudabant,
non quia nasus nullus erat sed credo hac mente quod hospes . .
commodius consumeret3 cf. Or. 2. 72, Lael. 2. 13, Hor. Ep. 1.

24. de me meriti: alluding to his exile.

25. ut eorum reprehensionem etc., ‘so that you who are
men of considerable insight ought to take upon yourselves the
duty of criticising these witnesses (and weighing their evidence),
