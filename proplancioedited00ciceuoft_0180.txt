μ92 CICERO'S ORATION FOR PLANOIUS

this method of forming a panel is fair in any case of corrupt
practices <and I hardly think it is) except in these cases which
affect the tribes as such, Ι fail to see why it was only in cases
of this nature that the senate decreed that the tribes from
which the jury were chosen should be named by the prosecutor,
and did not apply this same system of nomination to all other
cases3 Ι do not see why, in a case of mere corrupt practices,
the senate instituted the right of challenging the jurymen
by both litigants, and whilst employing every form of severity
it yet chose not to avail itself of this form, i.e. compelling the
case to be tried by iuddces editicii!

13.c.‚ was thus eight years Cicero's senior. He began his
oratorical career at eighteen, when he delivered his first speech
in the Forum. He was for a long time the leading counsel of
the Roman bar, until in 70 Β. 0. Cicero displaced him, having
