torture-evidenee ete.

Of. Cornif. 11. 2-9 or the analysis of the work given in
Wilkin's de Oratore introd. p. 55.

ἕ 34. IV. Restitutio, λύσις (reprehensio).

The object of the refutatio is to refute everything
which the opponent has urged or may urge against the
speaker3 summed up by the Greek writers under the
one word ἀντίθεσις.

Aristotle, Anaximenes, Cornificius, and Cicero treat
λύσις as part of the πίστεις; Quintilian (v. 13) was the
first to make it into a separate division.

The ἄντίθεσεις which the λύσις must refute are of
two kinds (a) ἄτεχνοι and (β) ἔντεχνοι or παραδειγμα-
τικοί, and of these it may attaek either (i.) the material,
or (ii.) the formal part, or (iii.) both 3 it will do so by
ἄντισυλλογισμός, counter-argument‚ or ἐνστάσεις, irb-
stcmtiae, objections, instanees. Later rhetoricians dis-
tinguished two kinds of λύσις- ’

(i.) λύσις κατὰ ἀνατροπήν (οΓ κατ’ ἔνστασιν), a direct refutation
of the facts ; in cases of coniectura and definiti&

(ii.) λύσις κατὰ μέθοδον, indam, in* statu qualitatis, et in
translatione. Within this again the μέθοδοι were earefully sub-
divided, the most important bein g—

μέθοδος κατὰ περιτροπήν, taking the opponent’s argument
and converting it to one’s own use, Arist. Rhea, ii. 23. 7,
Quint. v. 13. 29.

μέθοδος κατὰ σύγκρουσιν, showing that the statements clash,
are inconsistent, Quint. v. 13. 30, Arist. Rhet. ii. 29.

μέθοδος κατὰ μείωσιν, elevatio, depreciation‚ Quint. v. 13. 22.
