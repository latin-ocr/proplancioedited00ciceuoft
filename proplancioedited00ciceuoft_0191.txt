10. L. Philippus, as tribune of the plebs <103 13.c.) and
consul (93 Β.ο.), showed himself a vigorous. Optimate and an

of the Sullan party. As an orator he was very distinguished
and is spoken of by Cicero in the highest terms (Brut. ἐξ 103,
106, de Or. 3 ξ 4 etc.) For an anecdote about him and a
praeco Volteius Menas vide Hor. Ep. 1. 7. 46 strenuus et fortis
causisque Philippus ayendis clarus etc.

11. G. Caelius: the MSS. read Q.; this editors have
altered to 0., and applied the reference to O. Caelius Caldus, ’
consul in 94 B.c. and author of the lex tabellaria; but, as
Mommsen Staatsrecht i. 542 note 2 shows, his name was
Coelius, not Caelius ; it seems more probable therefore that we
should read Q. Aelius, i.e. Q. Aelius Paetus, consul in 217 B.c.

Cases of the omission of the quaestorship in a political career
are few, but cf. that of the elder Africanus, CIL. 1. 280.

12. P. Rutilius Rufus: consul in 105 B.c. with Cn. Mallius
Maximus. In 99 Β.(.·. he accompanied L. Mucius Scaevola pont.
as leqatus to Asia, where he protected the provincials against
the oppression of the publicani; the equites consequently on
his return to Rome brought a false charge of embezzlement
(repetundae) against him, in consequence of which he retired as
an exile to Mytilene, and afterwards to Smyrna, where he spent
the rest of his life in literary pursuits, especially the composition
of a history of Rome in Greek 3 cf. pro Bab. Post. ἓ 27, pro Balb.
ἓ 28, Brut. ἐξ 85, 113. ·

Ο. Fimbria: vide note on ξ 12.

13. C. Cassius Longinus: consul 96 B.c. with Dem.
Ahenobarbus.

Gn. Aufidius Orestes: consul in 71 13.c. ; praetor urbanus
in the year of Sulla's death, 78 Β.ο.

18. cursum tenendum: a nautical metaphor for others,
vide note on ἓ 11 and cf. ἕ 94.

20. detractum dico? an instance of the rhetorical figure
correctio or προδιόρθωσις, closely allied to the traiectio in aliud
with which Cicero says (de Or. 3 ἓ 204) aliquid α te ipse reicias.
The figure is often strengthened by immo vero, e.g. Catil. 1 ἓ 2
hic bene vivit. vivit ? immo vero etiam in senatum venit ; cf. pro
sest. ξ 110, ad Aa. 9. 7.

22. significatum, ‘indicates your worth‚' i.e. the people
wished to reserve him for some greater office.
