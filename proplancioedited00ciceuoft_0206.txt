'118 cIOERo’s ORATION Fon PLAncms

five days, Metellus refused, and rather than cause a disturbance
went into voluntary exile at Rhodes (pro Pl. §ss 36, 88). He
was recalled in 99 Β. c. by the lem Calvum, to which very little
opposition was made.

10. suo nomine t i.e. servator rei publicae, vide supra.
Cassius seems to have said ‘ Opimius saved the state and yet was
condemned, Calidius restored the great Metellus to Rome and
yet was condemned, Plancius restored Cicero—surely he should
be condemned too)

XXIX. 12. Q. Metellus Pius, son of Metellus Numidicus,
was praetor in 87 Rc. and distinguished himself by his services
in the Social war ; was instrumental in procuring the election of
Calidius to the praetorship. As proconsul in Spain he conducted
the war against Sertorius for eight years and was awarded a
triumph at its close in 72, so that at the time of Calidius’
impeachment he must have been absent from Rome3 cf. infra
si Romae esse potuisset.

14. supplicasse: i. e. that the Roman people should elect
Calidius to the praetorship.

cum quidem, ‘ and what is more, on that occasion . .
15. illum: Calidius.

§70 1. 16. quo loco, ‘and whilst we are on this topic’3
locus here almost in the rhetorical sense, cf. τόπος.

19. nam is elliptical‚ ‘ I do not mention Opimius’ case in the
same category, for . .'; cf. ἓξ 21, 38.

23. illi iudices: the jury were at this time chosen from the
senate3 Cicero here, as in V err. act. pr. § 38, implies that had
they been chosen from the equites such a shameful verdict
would never have been given.

et non, ‘ and not much rather ’ ; ac ‘non is used similarly in
the formula of correctio ; cf. ἐξ 61, 71, de Off. 1 ἕ 5.

parricidae, ‘sacrilegious wretches‚’ ‘traitors ' 3 used similarly
of Catiline's associates, Sall. Cat. 51. 25, of Antony’s adherents‚
Plane. ap. Cic. Fam. 10. 23 etc. The history of the word is un-
certain ; it may = patricida=qui patrem caedit, but Th. Mommsen
Rom. Staatsr. ii. p. 541 connected the first part of the word with
perperam, periurium etc.; it would thus: ‘a murderer of the
worst kind' and to be visited with the worst penalties3 this
would agree with its earliest use in the law si qui hominem

liberum dolo sciens ‘morti duit patricidas emto ,· cf. Osenbriiggen·
Wirz on pro Mil. ξ 17.

26. finitimo bello: in 123 13.c. he captured the Volseian town
