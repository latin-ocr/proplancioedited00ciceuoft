INTRODUGTION xlix

Rhetoric diligently since Zeno's time, regarding it as
a subdivision of their science of Logic, and especially
developing the introductory parts of Rhetoric together

⁸ with inventio and dispositio— the determining and

arranging the subject-matter. Unfortunately none of
the actual works of Stoic rhetoricians have come down to

> us, but we have two treatises by late Latin writers based
' on the Stoic system, Ohirius Fortunatianus (A.D. 450)

and Sulpitius Victor. It was in Pergamum, the Asiatic 1

ἱ rival of Alexandria for the pre-eminence in the world of
'y culture, that the Stoics first began to influence literature

and education3 here they anticipated their Alexandrino
fellows in the combination of grammar with Rhetoric, in

* the literary criticism of ancient authors, especially the

consideration of their style 3 and here the canon of the ten
Attic orators was set up and the superiority assigned to
Demosthenes, which we find maintained throughout the
Latin writers on Rhetoric. The connecting link between
the Latin rhetoricians and the Pergamene Hermagoras,
Stoics is Hermagoras of Temnos (flor. 150 15⁰ Μ·
B.c.), who probably lived for some time at Pergamum, and
at any rate belongs to the Pergamene school of thought.

1 Pergamum (now Pergamo) was the capital of the kingdom of

2 Pergamus and afterwards of the Roman province of Asia3 it was
'b situated on the river Caicus in S. Mysia. The city first acquired

5·

importance under Lysimachus, who, after the defeat of Antigonus
at Ipsus in 301, considerably enlarged and beautified it. The
zenith of its power was reached under Eumenes ΙΙ., who founded

its libram the formation of which occasioned the invention of
parchment, charta Perqamena.
