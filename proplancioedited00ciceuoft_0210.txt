that Cicero would have done wisely to omit this allusion
to his verses, quae mihi videntur opera minus diq‘na talis viri
nomme.

7. esse videatur: on the rhythm of the ending vide ἓ 4.

XXXI. ἓ 75 1. 8. clamitas, ‘ you keep shrieking out,’ a hit
at Laterensis’ delivery3 ef. Brut. ξ 182, where the clamator is
opposed to the orator.

quo usque ista dicis? ‘how long are you going to go on
talking in that strain ’ἒ ’ i. e. trying to move the feelings of the
jurymen by enumerating the kindnesses you had received at
the hands of the aeeused. dicis in a semi-future sense used to

add vividness. The words are the words of Laterensis, and
spoken with indignation.

9. M. Cispius was plebeian tribune in 57 B.c. when Cicero
was restored from exile. He exerted himself on Cicero’s behalf,
and as a result was maltreated by Clodius’ hired ruffians. He
was also aecused by his politieal opponents of ambitus, and, in
spite of Cicero’s pathetie defenee of him, was convicted.

obsoletae, ‘ used up,’ ‘ out of date,’ ‘useless' 3 the MS.
reading is absolutae, of which Graevius said pathetically quid sit
preces absolvere plane iquoro.

10. obicies, ‘will you bring up Cispius’ trial against me—
Cispius whose services to me I first was made aware of by your
testimony, and whom Ι defended on your recommendation too?
And will you taunt me with your “how much longer2''—me
whose efforts on Cispius’ behalf you admit were quite unsue-
cessful‘3'

15. invidia, ‘invidious meaning,’ ‘malicious import.’ The
two meanings are (1) what Laterensis really meant, ‘how long
will you go on with your pathetie and tearful defences, seeing
that it does your elients no good 2 You had much better stop ² 3
(2) what Cicero makes out to have been Laterensis’ meaning,
‘we are tired of your tearful speeehes; we have been induced
by them on several occasions to pardon defendants for your
sake, but we ean’t put up with them any longer.’ This remark
Cicero shows is unreasonable. It could only apply if it were
true that his pathetie speeehes had proeured aequittal for his
elients; but, as Laterensis himself has said, in the case of
Cispius this was not so.

datus est ille, ‘ one man has been surrendered to you ’ ; for
the prosopopoeia cf. ξ 12.

condonatus est ille, ‘another has been pardoned out of
respect for you, for your prayers.'
