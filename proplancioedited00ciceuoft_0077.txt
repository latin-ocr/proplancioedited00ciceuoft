of a metallic nature, neither washing nor seraping
could obliterate it entirely3 and by the application of
various chemical reagentS, especially hydro-sulphurate of
ammonia,1 the writing can be made visible again, some-
times permanently, sometimes only temporarily, photo-
graphy too has been of great service in deciphering
palimpsests.

The text of these Scholia Bobiensia is in two parts, ,
pars Ambrosiaua from Tusculanos in ἓ 23 to the end of

mat. med. 5. 182) it was composed of three parts lampblack

mentions the rubbing of ink (ξ 258 τὸ μέλαν τρίβων). . The fiuid of
the cuttlefish (Sepia) was also used, but is not mentioned until the
Roman period. Both of these kinds of ink could be washed
entirely out, and a sponge is frequently mentioned as a necessary
part of writing apparatus3 cf. the witticism of Augustus (Suet.
Auy. 89) about his unfinished tragedy‚ Ajacem suum iu spouyeam
incubuisse. In the case, however, of the Berlin fragment of
Ἀθηναίων πολιτεία a good deal of illegible writing on the papyrus
was made legible by means of a very light sort of varnish. For
parchment lampblack ink was unsatisfactory, and a ferrugineous
gall-apple ink was adopted, first mentioned by Martianus Capella
(ΑΔ). 425) as ¹mullorum ‘yummeosquc commixtio. In the Middle
Ages vitriol ink was made by adding vitriol to the gall-apple ink.
In preparing this the mixture was heated in some way or another,
and was called in consequence ἔγκαυστον, Latin incaustum, Italian
iucMostro, French encre, Dutch inkt, English ink. In addition
to these black inks the Egyptians, and after them the Greeks and
Romans, used a red ink usually of cinnabar (κιννάβαρι), 01· red-
lead (minium) ; this was especially used for titles‚ hence rubrica,
a red title of a law, then the law itself, Pers. v. 90’ (Miiller
IIaudbuch i. p. 179).

¹ The commonest reagent in former times was tincture of gall ; as
this, however, turns the whole parchment black, it is unsatisfactory.
