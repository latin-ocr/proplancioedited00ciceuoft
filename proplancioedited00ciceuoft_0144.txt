56 CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

6. oum autem audirem‘: an instance of the rhetorical
figure simulatio (Cornif. 4. 26). Cicero knows (as is evident from
c. 15) that most of his audience are opposed to him, but
pretends (simulat) that it is not so, because at one time some
of their number supported his recall from exile, and Plancius’
kindness then they must have approved of.

meos . . inimicos . . invidos: both adjectives are here
used as substantive83 generally speaking, the principle is not
common in Latin, cf. N'agelsbach Lat. Stil. 263 such sub-
stantivised adjectives are usually of the second declension‚ with
three main uses—(a) concrete plurals: vera, boui, recti ; (β)
abstract singulars z honestum, sapiens, rectum ; (γ) neuter plurals,
but nearly always in the accusative or nominative. With regard
to the imitation of these uses the one criterion is clear‘ness: is
the sentence absolutely free from all ambiguity? inimici
manifesti suut, invidi obscuri, Ernesti.

9. dolebam si: cf. Livy 2. 28 indiyuatione patrum si
iuvidiam consules . . reicerent ,· cf. ‘miror si, Gk. εἰ.

10. infestior: in a passive sense, ‘imperilled'3 cf. pro Rosc.
Am. 30 filii vita infesta, ‘mare infestum.

12. praesidio custodiaque: for the combination of two
almost synonymous expressions cf. in this exordium alone
eqreqia et sinqularis, dolebam et acerbe ferebam, praesidio
custodiaque, conspectus et consessus, reficit et recreat, intueor et con·
temptor, ‘nou sumo ‘neque adroqo, and numerous other instances
throughout the speech. There seems little doubt that this
trick of rhetorical pleonasm was a peculiarity of Cicero’s style ;
the words which are joined are not always exactly synonymous,
and as far as combinations are not merely the result of a
rhetorical desire to use as many words as possible and yet not
be definite, we may say that they are equivalent to a strengtben-
ing adverb ; thus reficit et recreat ‘ considerably revives me ' 3 so
relinquere et deserere ‘ to utterly abandon,’ bellum denuntiatur
et iudicitur ‘ war is formally declared’ ; so oro atque obsecro,
divelle ac distraho, sundere et fuglam, reicere et aspernari, pro-
spicere et consulere ; vide Heynacher Lat. Stilistik p. 30.

2 §2 l. 1. unum quemque, ‘each individual.’
2. hoc in numero = horum iu numero.

3. exstet, ‘stands out prominently! The Latin language .
prefers to use a picturesque vivid word where in English we
should often use the mere copula ‘ to be ' ; similarly the Latius
usually prefer a compound verb to a simple one.
