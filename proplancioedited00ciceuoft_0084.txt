lxxx CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

29-35 Laterensis has cast certain aspersione on Plancius’ char-
acter. These, Cicero shows, arc either (1) untrue, or (2)
mere distortione of facts really creditable to Plancius.
It has been urged that the character of Plancius' father
ought to have been a hindrance to his son’s election;
the reverse was the case. The elder Plancius is a
well-known Roman knight, distinguished as a soldier,
judge, and director of several of the great tax-farming
companies. He may at times have expressed him-
self rather freely on political matters, but that has
always been, as it were, a privilege of the knights, and
implies no malice or dishonesty.

36-48 Laterensis' object in accusing Plancius under the lex
Licinia de sodaliciis (illegal combinatione) was that he
might be enabled to choose a jury suitable to his
interests ; in this case he only deals with circumstances
which come under the head of ambitus, not the
{23⁰¹53213‘gr222205221ssf 8223&ss 52²⁶?ss in {35031333213}
jurymen from the members of the tribes whom he
maintains without proof may have been bribed.
Cicero shows that the Licinian law is inapplicable here,
and challenges his opponent to show any violation of
the laws of sodalicium, e.g. decuriatio, or buying votes.
Plancius had merely availed himself of the ordinary
method of gaining the goodwill of his fellow-
citizens.

49-50 Plancius was as good as elected to the aedileship in the
preceding year, when the elections were postponed.
Even supposing he had wished to employ bribery, it
would have been impossible owing to the short notice
given of the comitia. All the same, if Laterensis had
exerted himself to win popularity he might have
gained several votes.

51-52 Laterensis need not consider that he has disgraced his
name and his ancestry by this repulse, for (1) similar
cases have often occurred before where the people have
passed over men in the election to less important
offices and yet have entrusted them with the higher
honours of the State 3 Laterensis’ career is not neces-
sarily spoilt. (2) Laterensis made a serious mistake
in retiring from his canvass for the tribuneship in the
consulate of Caesar and Bibulus, for this showed a too
independent spirit to please the people.
