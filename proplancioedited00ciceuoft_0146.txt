58 CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

men, if any fault has been found in myself without my client
being involved in it, it does not seriously disquiet me3 for Ι
am not apprehensive that, because instances of gratitude are
extremely rare, the fact that Ι have been called needlessly
grateful will be brought up against me.’

The sense—rhythm of the period seems rather laboured3 the
two ideas which Cicero wished to emphasise, mm timeo and
criminosum esse possit, are placed at the beginning and end of
the period in order to be thrown into the highest relies. The
period may be represented A l a (a) l a (β) α, where A=the
main sentence, a=the subordinate sentence neit close to it in
connection, α = a clause subordinate to a, β a second clause
dependent on A ; cf. Gildersleeve Lat. Gr. ξ 434.

29. nimium gratum: Cicero does not use nimium with
adjectives very often, but more usually nimis, nimium with
adjectives being rather poetica13 cf.‚ however, ἓ 82 nimiwm
beatus, de Fin. 5. 81 ‘nimium Zonyum. In sense nimium here:
‘extremely,’ ‘unusually,' ‘ very‚' praeter modum, a sense which
it usually has in older and colloquial Latin, e.g. Plautus.
This is probably one of those colloquialisms which occasionally
occur in Cicero’s speeches, e. g. nullus esse, ampleoeo, ni=si non,
potest impers.‚ etc.; cf. Fausset pro Gluent. p. xxxvi.

6. ne non tam . . quam, ‘in order that more by . .
than ’ ; the negativas cancel each other.

7. temporum: cf. 1. 1.

ess} vffdeatur: for the rhythm of the ending cf. ξ 2 jecisse} ’ἦ
υἶοῑέᾶίᾶν, which is substituted for fecerit merely for the sake of
euphony. Quintilian describes this ending, ess& videatur, as
iam paene ‘nimis usitatum ; vide Cic. Or. 64, de Or. 47—49,
Ar. Rha. 3. 8, Quint. 9. 4. 45.

ἓ 5 l. 8. facili etc., ‘but although the case is so simple
and straightforward, yet the line of defence which Ι see is put
forward is an extremely difficult one, and requires very delicate
handling.’ facilis op osed to perdifficilis, explicatus ‘ clear’
opposed to lubricus ‘s ippery‚' ‘treacherous’ ; cf. de Off. 1. 19.

6Β5. Ζοσμεέαῗίεέιέ ,· for a Slmilar metaphor scopulosuszdz'ffioilis,
