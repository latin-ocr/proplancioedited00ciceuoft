APPENDIX 141

member never sued another at laW‚ but was always ready to
lend assistance to him in legal difficulties. No sodalis ever sat
on a jury when the prosecutor was a member of the same
sodalitas. As in our Masonic lodges, if a member at his death
left his children unprovided for, the sodales took measures sor
their education etc. This system of mutual assistance was
naturally extended to municipal matters and elections, which
afforded the best opportunities for making some return for
benefits reeeived.1 Thus the lex Servilia (repetundarum) for-
bids a. man to be patronus, or iudea: queive eiei (reo) sobrinus ,
siet propiusve eum coqnatione attiyat queive eiei sodalis siet queive

ἢ in eodem colleyio siet. But the sodalitates soon degenerated

from their original character, and became instruments of
electoral corruption. In 56 B.c., two years before Plancius’
trial, senatus consultum sactum est, ut sodalitates decuriatique
discederent leaeque de eis ferretur, ut, qui non discessissent, ea
poena, quae est de vi, tenerentur.2

(2) The colleyia were really quilds, associations of persons
who (α) held the same office or (β) practised the
same profession or trade, and their original object
was to further the interests of, and improve the methods of, that
profession or trade. Like the sodalitates, the colleyia had their
special sacrifices and religious rights, the same mutual obliga-
tions of member to member. As instances of (α) we may take
the colleyia pontificum, auqurum, tribunorum,3 or the colleqium
(or mayistri) Mercurialium, founded (Livy 2. 27) on the dedica-
tion of the new temple of Mercury: as new gods were intro-
duced in Rome, new colleyia were founded.4 We find similar
combinations in Greece, e.g. οἱ Ἀσκληπιάδαι, the guild for
preserving the cult of Asclepius and furthering the interests of
the profession over which he presided.⁶ (β) Trade-guilds were
more numerous, e.g. colleqia fabrorum, aerariorum, tiynariorum,
ferrariorum, sutorum, fullonum, pistorum etc.‚ most of which
- dated their foundation in remote antiquity.

These colleyia, like the sodalitates, were used sor political
ends, and in 68 B.c. were abolished in the consulship of L.
Caec. Metellus and Q. Marcius Rex. Clodius, however in
56 B.c., in response to the repeated appeals of the rabble of the
city, passed the law de colleqiis restituendis novisque instituendis,
especially referring to the re-establishment of the colleqia com-

Colleqia.
