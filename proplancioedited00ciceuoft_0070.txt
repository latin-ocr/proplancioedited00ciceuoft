lxvi CICERO'S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

ἕ 38. V. Peroratio, ἐπίλογος (conclusio or cumulus),
Arist. Rhea. iii. 19, Cornif. 30. 47, Cic. de Iuv. 1. 52. 98.

‘buffoonery,’ Arist. Bket. iii. 19, Cic. Orat. 26. 90, de
Or. 2. 58-71 3 cf. Cramer Anecd. Paris. i. p. 403.

In the treatment of ἐλέου εἰσβολή, the stirring up
