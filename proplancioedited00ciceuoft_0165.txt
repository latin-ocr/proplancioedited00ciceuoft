NOTES 77

8. nisi forte: ironical, so nisi vero ; cf. pro Mur. §13, pro
Sext. Rosa. ἕ 82.

Labicana: Labici, or Labicum (Verg. Aen. 7. 796 picti scuta
Labici), a small township about 15 miles south-east of Rome,
between Tusculum and Praeneste.

Gabina: Gabii, between Rome and Praeneste, 12 miles due
east of the capital. Originally one of the most important towns

Ἴ of the Latin league, it was now decayed and deserted ; cf. Hor.
Ep. 1. 11. 7 Gabiis desertior, Juv. 3. 192.

9. Bovillae: about 10 miles south of Rome on the Via
Appia3 like Gabii, a populous and important member of the
Latin league until it was destroyed by Coriolanus. It is best
known as having been the scene of Clodius’ murder by Milo ; cf.
Cic. pro Mil. passim.

10. Latinis: sc. feriis, cf. comitiis, 9Zadiatoribus, ludis,
¹ Saturnalibus etc. The Feriae Latinae (or Latinae simply, cf.
Cio. ad Aa. 1. 3, Livy 5. 17) was an old festival of the Latin
. league celebrated on the Mons Albanus, because Alba originally
⁴ was the leading state of the league (pro Mil. ἓ 85). The
, festival as organised by Tarquinius Superbus consisted in the
sacrifice of white oxen (sacrificium Latinarum) to Jupiter
Latiaris, and the representative of each Latin town was given
Ξὲἳῖιῗςῗψῗῖἑὴῗ ygzthngbgpl:2213AE{wlgfficqffpstyagaeXZzZ-Zeffffffpwzi
Romanis). Even after the Romans had complete hegemony
’ over Latium the festival was still celebrated. The date of the
3 Feriae Latinae was not fixed by law3 it was one of the first
¹ duties of the consuls before leaving for their provinces to decide
when they should take place. Since the festival lasted four
ἴ days, during which no public business could be transacted, this
power of the consuls of deciding when the Feriae should take
place became a powerful political engine in repressing any

unconstitutional movement ; cf. Cic. Q. Fr. 11. 6, Livy 21.
’ 63, Marquardt R. H. iv. 441.

, 12. publicanum : at Rome those taxes and imposts which
varied with the condition of trade, e. g. the portoria, harbour-dues‚

Ϊ were sold by the State to the publicani or tax-farmers for a lump
Ἴ sum of money, the State being represented in the contract by
r . the censors. The publicani then collected the taxes, vectiqalia,

·' themselves whereas in the case of tributum and the stipendium of
the provinces the State was responsible for its collection. The
publicani became a very important body in Rome, and were
, often very useful to the State in the matter of public loans, etc.‚
