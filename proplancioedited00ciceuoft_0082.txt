hand that his enemies were taking the part of
Laterensis against his client and himself in this trial,
because Plancius had befriended him after his exile,
at the same time expresses his joy at seeing no one in
the jury who has not a warm sympathy for himself
and Plancius. However‚ it is not because of his
services to Cicero that Plancius is to be acquitted, but
because his innocence will be proved, and only after
proof has been given will the speaker appeal to *the

4 jury to acquit his client. The defence presents many

difficulties, as Cicero 1s compelled to defend not only
Plancius but himself by the line which his opponents
have taken of attacking him indirectly through
Plancius, and trying to show that the services rendered
by the latter have been overstated and exaggerated.
That this is untrue Cicero hopes to show, and at the
same time he points out to the J‘ury that the services
of Plancius ought to have considerable weight with
them in making their verdict.

5 Laterensis has no right to complain that in the election

of aediles he has been passed over and Plancius
elected3 sor the people neither criticise nor condemn-
in their elections, but follow their caprice3 without
maintaining in th'e least that Laterensis 1s inferior to
Plancius or any other candidate, yet, Cicero believes,
Laterensis has no right to blame the people for their
choice, he must abide by their decision.

5-11 For, firstly, the choice of the people in the electione

depends not on judgment but caprice, and we must
acquiesce in their choice.
