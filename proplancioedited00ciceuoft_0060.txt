lvi CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

chosen words, perspicuity, and the avoidance of anything
which may seem in bad taste, such as pleonasms‚ tauto-
logy, frigidity of style (Arist. Rket. iii. 3 τὸ ψυχρόν);
(β) Ornatus, ornaments of language, metaphors, tropes
etc., rhetorical devices, especially fiyurae sententiarum,
such as rhetorical questions, interroyatio, reticentia
,(ἀποσιώπησις), dissimulatio (εἰρωνεία etc.), and fiqurae
verborum or grammatical figures, e. g. prolepsis, ἀνα-
δίπλωσις etc., all of which were most carefully elabo-
rated, cf. Quint. ix. 1. 33 (γ) Collocatio, compositio, i.e.
the arranging language in periods and sentences, with
due attention to connexion, cadence, and rhythm.

IV. The next duty of an orator was to learn his
speech by heart —memoria, μνήμη, cf. Cornif. 3. 16,
Cic. de Or. 2. 351, Quint. xi.

V. Lastly, under the division Actio (pronuntiatio,
ὑπόκρισις) came the study of delivery, with considera-
tions of tone, voice, gesture etc.; cf. Longin. p. 310
ἔστι δὲ ὑπόκρισις μίμησις τῶν κατ’ ἀλήθειαν ἑκάστῳ
παρισταμένων ἠθῶν Καὶ παθῶν Καὶ διάθεσις σώματός ΤΕ
καὶ τόνου φωνῆς προσ-φόρου τοῖς ὑποκειμένοις πράγμασι,
Gornif. 3. 11. 19, Cic. de Or. 3. 213, Brut. 141, 203,
278, 303, Quint. xi. 3.

As mentioned above, under the head Iuventio came
the five 1 divisions of a speech—

1 Arist. Rhet. iii. 13. 1 divides a speech into πρόθεσις and πίστις,
but states that πρόλογος and ἐπίλογος were usually added. The
fivefold division rests on the Stoic - Hermagoraic system, Cicero
(de Im). 1. 42) and Quintilian (v. 13). But each rhetorician was
arbitrary about his own system. 'Phe division in the text is such
as would probably have been taught in Cicero’s time.
