138 CICERO'S ORATION F ΟΒ. PLANCIUS l

27. non ego meis ε note here two peculiarities of the order
of words in a Latin sentence—(a) the negative stands first,
‘the love of distinctness led. the Latin writers in negative
sentences to stamp the negative form on the sentence as soon
as possible' Potts Lat. Pr. p. 59 3 (β) in a Latin sentence
pronouns seem to attraot each other ; cf. Hor. earm. 4. 9. 31-

ηοη 690 te meis
chartis irwrnatum silebo.

deprecor, ‘intercede for ’ a person ; cf. pro Mur. ξ 1. The
usual meaning is ‘to try and avert an evil by eries, entreaties.'

53 1. parens ε on the elder Plancius vide Introd. ἕ 13.

patres: paren3=merely the author of our being, a pro-
creator, and is used metaphorically in conjunction with effector,
conservator, artifex, procreatrix, educato-im ; pater-:one who is
legally reeognised as head of a family or an association of any
sort. Cicero called himself parens Romae, as being a second
founder of the city he had preserved ; pater patriae, as the
father of the family of the state, who exercised his right of
punishing the unruly members of that family. Cf. J nv, 8. 244
