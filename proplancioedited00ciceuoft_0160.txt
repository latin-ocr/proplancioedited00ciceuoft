foedus aequum, an alliance on equal terms with Rome. On

have been assimilated to that of the coloniae. ΙΙΙ. praefecturae:
these received their name from being the headquarters of the
praefecti or IVviri iuri dicundo sent out annually from Rome
to administer J'ustice. All towns in Italy which had not the
privilege of electing their own magistrates must be classified as
praefecturae ; cf. Festus praefecturae eae appellabantur in
Italia in quibus et ius dicebatur et nundinae ayebantur. et erat
