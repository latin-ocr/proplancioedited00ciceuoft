XIII. pater etc. ε the elder Plancius, at the time when he
was the most prominent of the publicani, made himself very
unpopular with the senatorial party3 and Laterensis had ex-
pressed the opinion that his support would or should only
prejudice his son’s case. The circumstances (vide Introd. § 13)
were briefly these: a societas or tax-farming joint-stock com-
pany, in 61—60 B.c.‚ of which Plancius was director, had bid for
and received the contracts for the taxes of Asia. Owing to the
Mithradatic war, which had reduced the resources of the
country, they found afterwards that it was impossible to get in '
enough money to make the contract pay3 they consequently
asked for an abatement. The senate was disinclined to grant
it3 finally, by Caesar's exertions, a reduction of a third was
granted. Cn. Plancius during the whole proceeding followed
a strong line, and did not hesitate to express his opinion openly
of the niggardliness of the senatorial party.

there are two main uses of this phrase, which, however, often
run into each other: (i.)=naturalis samm, the sense or instinct
given by nature to all sane men. Cicero uses the phrase in
this sense both in sing. and plur., cf. pro Cluenti. 17, de Orat.
