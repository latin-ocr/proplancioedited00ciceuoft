ANALYSIS OF THE SPEECH lxxxiii

himself at the time admitted that the jury were
affected by his speech.

77-82 According to the assertion of Laterensis, Plancius in his
tribunate has been shown far less actively zealous on
Cicero’s behalf than L. Racilius; Cicero's obligations to
Plancius are exaggerated. Cicero answers—-even sup-
posing Plancius had been less active in his support,
that is no proof that it was from want of willingness,
but merely that he, Cicero, must at some time repay
the services of Racilius. The senate had chosen out
Plancius to thank on Cicero’s behalf, how could he

therefore avoid seconding those thanks in the most ·

substantial manner at the first opportunity? Such an
opportunity is now present, as Plancius is in a dangerous
position. Cicero repudiates as salse Laterensis' state-

the State of his support, or the opportunity of showing
such gratitude as might be an example to posterity.

90-94 In answer to the assertion of Laterensis that Cicero had
sacrificed his independence by his flattery of Pomp'ey
and Caesar, he replies that he had always given his
best services to the Republic, but by various channels
and in varied spheres of activity3 still he was compelled
to have some little regard for his own safety‚ and he
has changed his political views only because that was
the way by which he could best further the State’s
welfare: a politician must always move with the
times.

94-100 Finally, Cicero maintains emphatically that Plancius'
