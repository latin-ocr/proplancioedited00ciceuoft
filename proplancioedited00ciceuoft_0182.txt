-94 CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANGIUS

tribes at Rome from 241 Rc. onwards‚ the 31 country ones
mentioned above and 4 town ones (Collina, Esquilina,
Palatina, Suburrana).

credo: ironical‚ ‘I suppose’; Plancius belonged to the
Teretine tribe3 Laterensis ought, according to the spirit of the
law, to have nominated this tribe, because it was one of the
tribes Plancius was said to have bribed ; cf. infra ad sententiam

Zeyis, Introd. ξ 6.
fuit = fuisset .· the indicative expressing the case vividly.

26. venditorem: in ἓ 45 the tribe is described as venalis ;
Plancius first bought over the whole tribe and then sold their
votes to Plotius, cf. ἒ 54. This coitio was put down to Plancius,
vide Introd. ἓ 3.

29. Voltiniam: sc. ‘I suppose you nominated . .’ The
Voltinian tribe, whose position in Latium is uncertain, sup-
ported Plancius strongly.

20 1. quid cum: sc. est, ‘what has Plancius to do with . . ’ζ’

Lemonia tribus: so named from the district Lemonium
outside the Porta Capena ; the Ufentina or Oufentina, from the
river Ufens near Privernum, was founded in 318 B. O., Livy 9.
20. 6. The territory of the Clustumina tribus lay near the old
Tuscan town Crustumerium‚· Livy 2. 19. These tribes are
frequently mentioned in inscriptions, e.g. C. Papirius G. F.
Clu. Carbo=Caius Papirius Carbo, son of Caius, of the Clustu-

mine tribe.

2. Maeciam: the Maecian tribe resided near the Castrum
Maecium, not far from Lanuvium 3 it was founded in 332 lac.
It was almost certain that Plancius would reject the Maecian

tribe, because probably Laterensis belonged to it, and. conse-
quently would have such infiuence in it that to Plancius it
would seem the most formidable of the four tribes nominated.

5. ad suam spem : Laterensis felt confident that the tribes
he nominated would condemn Plancius. ·

9. quid enim potest etc„ ‘for he can bring forward no Δ·
reason which could invalidate our statement that this nomi· ιζ
nation of tribes by the prosecutor is extremely harsh, if we J
are to set aside the motive which led us senators when we ᾗ
were discussing the proposed lex Licinia) ⁴

§ 40 1. 11. tu deligas, ‘ you’ll be choosing, I suppose 2' ·
deliyas is an instance of the potential use of the Latin subjunctive ’
put interrogatively. For the simple potential cf. Plautus Cure.
632 quaeratis clamudem ‘ you'll be asking for my cloak next,’ Ξ
