INTRODUCTION xlv

a Theory of Oratory, in short the art of Persuasion.
Thus the pre-Aristotelian definition, eg. of Gorgias
427 B.O. and Isocrates 380 Β.Ο., is ῥητορική ἔστι
τέχνη . . πειθοῦς ὃημίουργος.1 Aristotle himself
says (Rhet. i. 2 τέχνη ῥητορικὴ) δύναμις περὶ ἕκαστον
τοῦ θεωρῆσαι τὸ ἐνδεχόμενον πιθανόν, with which Her-
magoras agrees in the main, δύναμις τοῦ εῧ λέγειν;

by degreeS, however, Rhetoric was regarded less a‘s a

δύναμις, mere ability, skill, and more as a τέχνη, an
art or seience, technology, and the definition of Quintilian

ι based on Xenocrates may be taken as representing the

general view in Ciceronian times, bene dicendi scientia.

ἕ 24. Some short knowledge of Rhetoric and
its methods is a necessary complement of
classical studies in order to estimate the
extraordinary influence and importanee of oratory
in both the public and private life of the Greeks and
Romans, so large a part, too, of classical literature
is of a rhetorical nature that a knowledge of the tech-
nicalities of forensic composition is almost imperative
for a clear comprehension of them. Lastly, a subject
deserves more than a passing interest which for 2000
years was the chief, at times the only, educative agent
in the training of a gentleman: for from the year 400
B.c. in the hands of the Sophists3 at the various schools
of Rhetoric, such as that of Molon at Rhodes, to which
young Romans went as to a university3 at the univer-

Importance.
