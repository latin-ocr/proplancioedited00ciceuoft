NOTES 97

18. excitares, ‘ summon to give evidence '3 more commonly
simply citare, but cf. pro Bab. Post. ἓ 48.

20. suam: sc. Teretinam.

quaesitor: a judge or president for the time being of a
standing commission, quaestio perpetua. From the time of
Sulla (81 Rc.) to that of Caesar there were eight praetore who
presided over the proceedings in the different courts during
their year of office. The question as to which court each was
to preside over was decided by lot. If, as frequently hap-

pened, eight courts were not sufficient sor the transaction of all Α

the cases, a supplementary quaesitor might be appointed to
preside over an extra tribunal. Cf. Introd. ἓ 5.

25. sine ulla cupiditatis suspicione, ‘without any sus-
picion of party-spirit, party-interest ' 3 cf. V err. 11. 2 ἓ 12 quae-
stores vehementer istius cupidi.

27. iudices: as jurymen, members of the panel which was
called eonsilium.

XVIII. ἓ 44 1. 29. consilium, ‘motive’ ; but Cicero seems
· here to be playing on the double sense of the word. eonsilium
‘jury,’ vide preceding note, and eonsilium ‘motive,’ ‘in-
tention.'
22 2. tum: i.e. if you had nominated those tribes who were
best acquainted with Plancius and his case. illorum are the
members of those tribes.

3. sequestrem, ‘agent,' ‘depositary,’ who received money
for distribution as bribes ; vide ἓ 38 and Introd. ξ 16.

respuerent aures: a strong mixed metaphor which Cicero
uses three times elsewhere, Note the antitheses—respuerent
aures )( audirent ,· ‘nemo aquoscerent )( nos non timide confi-
teremur.

4. gratiosum, ‘influential’ ; used of social influence.

7. suffragatio: properly ‘voting for,’ then ‘support,’ ‘in-
terest,’ ‘favour.'

ἕ 45 1. 10. noster: i.e. the senatorial order.

nostra modica liberalitate, ‘a reasonable display of gen er-
osity on our side‚’ Cicero identifying himself with the average
candidate sor office. modica is semi-predicative. The Latins
do not as a rule use meus, tuus, noster etc. with a substantive
qualified by a mere epithetic adjective ; e.g. ‘noster bonus amicus
is not found, although such expressions as mea carissima filia
are, the reason being that the superlative conveys more than
the simple adjective, and is not a mere epithet.
