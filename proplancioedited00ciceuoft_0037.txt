INTRODUOTION xxxiii

ἓ 17. Wherein then did the crime of sodalicium differ
from ambitus?

The distinction between the two can be arrived at
only by looking at the question legally, and considering
the different enactments made for their repression. This
much seems clear ε several laws were passed to check the
growing corruption at elections—-thesc were the loyes
de ambitu ‚· they were for the most part unavailing.

Legislation was then directed against a new and growing ·

method of corruption, the electioneering clubs——these
were the ἱερᾶς de sodaliciis ,· but—a not uncommon
phenomenon in Roman legislation—the two sets of laws
traversed the same ground. The laws de sodaliciis were
more fully developed and elaborate enactments, which
attempted by a process of narrowing down to fasten
on the more minute details of corrupt electioneering.
But there is no doubt that the term ambitus is often
used very loosely. The points in which the loyes de
sodaliciis differed from those de ambitu may be roughly
tabulated:—

(1) They were directed especially at corrupt practices carried
on by means of sodalicia.

(2) The court before which the cases came had to be composed
of iudices editicii, a fact which worked considerably in favour
of the prosecutor ; vide supra ἓ 6.

(3) The penalties were greater.

(4) The reward offered to a successful prosecutor was probably
larger.

(5) Any citizen might be tried by them—not merely a suc-
cessful candidate, but any one, whether in or out of office,
who was supposed to have made use of the sodalicia.
