INTRODUCTION lxi

make the uncertain seem credible by means of the certain
and the probable. Just as in Logic all proofs which
convey a subJective conviction rest on Induction
(ἐπαγωγή Quint. V. ll) or Syllogism (συλλογισμός,
conclusion), eoin Rhetoric proofs are based on παράδειγμα
and ἐνθύμημα, rhetorical induction and rhetorical con-
clusion. As the παράδειγμα is a short form of induction,

so ἐνθύμημα is a short form of syllogism, usually merely .

a statement with the grounds on which it is based. The
enthymeme is built up from the probable and from
indications, ἐξ εἰκότων and εἰ( σημείων.

It was in this division of the speech (probatio) that
theoretical rhetoricians found scope for the introduction
of noveltieS, and very various systems were set forward,
which really differ in unimportant details (Quint. iii. 6.
22 of tractatio, constitutio causae in hoc praecipue videtur
mihi studium diversa tradendi fuisse). The ingenuity of
teachers of Rhetoric was especially devoted to the elabora-
tion of loci, τόποι, under this head3 Cornificius <and
Cicero) thus treat, it would seem, this section on proofs,
tractatio, as a special heading of Topica. Tractatio 1
thus consists of—

(1) Probabile, i.e. cui bono? who is interested? who is prob-
ably guilty ’.ἰ considering (a) causa, (β) vita.

(2) OoZlatio: how far do the allegations fit? who else is as
likely to be guilty ’ἔ

(3) Siqua: arguments taken from place, time, duration,
opportunity etc.

(4) Arqumcntum .· positive evidence.

(5) Consecutio .· evidence from subsequent behaviour.
