friend Hortensius, But about the year 78 B.O.‚ shortly
after the acquittal of Roscius, Cicero was compelled by
ill-health2 to retire temporarily from the bar; he proceeded
to Rhodes, where he devoted two years to studying
Rhetoric under Molo, whose lectures he had attended in

¹ Rome in 88. This Rhodian school, of which Molo was
now head, may be regarded as directly descended from

that of Hermagoras. Their model was Hypereides,3 the
representative of the ‘plain' school. Cicero and Quintilian
talk of the Rhodian school as intermediate between the
earlier florid Asianism and the simpler Attic style,
but there seems little doubt that it approximated more
closely to the Asiatic than the Attic school.4 But Cicero
was no servile follower of a school 3 his was an eclectio
system, the factors of which may be considered as the
technical system of Molo plus an independent study of
Isocrates and probably Aristotle, plus a great amount of
experience derived from a large practice at the bar,5 plus
a keen perception of style and phraseology and an almost
perfect mastery of the Latin language. As time
went on Cicero became more and more Attic in his
tendencies, simplifying his style and adopting as his
model Demosthenes. In dealing with his actual speeches
