80 CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

nomen absentis: cf. Livy 36. 7 vim tuam praesentis
exercitusque tui eaperiri.

22. an . . miraris: the whole sentence from an Minturnenses
to fuisse miraris is worth analysing as a well-balanced double
period. In the language of rhetoric it is an arynmentatio α pari,
ἐξ ἴσων, cf. Quint. 5. 11, a comparison of two equale: ‘If the
people of Minturnae are immortalised for their kindness to
Marius, it is surely natural that Plancius should derive some
distinction for his kindness to me.' The arqwmentatio is
contained in two periods, an . . versantur, and Plancio . .
miraris. The second is peculiarly compact and precise3 in it ς
note (α) Plancio at the beginning, Laterensis in miraris at the ,ἱ
end3 (β) fidem corresponding to receperit, ‘misericordiam to
iuverit, virtutem to custodierit and conservarit.

Minturnenses: in 88 B.c. Sulla, with whom Marius had ε
quarrelled‚ obtained the chief command in the war against ξ
Mithradates, and marched on Rome to repress Marius and his 2
supporters, who wished to deprive him of his command. Marius ¹
escaped from Rome by sea, but was compelled by stress of 1
weather to put in at the mouth of the Liris (Garigliano). After Ξ
hiding in a marsh for a time hc was discovered and handed 1
over to the magistrates of Minturnae, who at first imprisoned
him, but afterwards treated him with great kindness and put
him on a vessel on which he succeeded in reaching Africa. His
flight is admirably described in Plutarch Mar. 36-39 3 also cf.
Valer. Max. 2. 10. 6 and 8. 2. 3, Cic. pro Sest. ἕ 50, de Fin. 2
ἓ105, in Pis. ἓ 43, J uxr. 10. 276 amilium et carcer Minturna-
rumque paludes etc.

23. impiis manibus: it is said that an executioner (carnifex)
was sent to bring him back to Rome.

27. servarat: i.e. from the Teutones at Aquae Sextiae in
102 B.C. and the Cimbri at Vercellae in 101 B.c.

ominibus, ‘ good wishes ' ; cf. in Pis. ἓ 31 eqressum ominibus
prosequebantur.

29. ratione: a full account of the motives of Cicero’s ¹
retirement from Rome is given in his speech post ‘reditum ἐξ 32-
36; cf. infra ἐξ 35, 37. Cicero always wishes to represent his
retreat as entirely voluntary and made on patriotic grounds,
to save the State from being embroiled in faction for his sake ;
vide especially pro Sest. cc. 17-19.

14 ]. honori seems to combine the two senses of ‘ distinction ’
and ‘the obtaining of office)
