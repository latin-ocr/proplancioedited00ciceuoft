lxxiv CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

the commentary, and pars Vaticana containing com·
mentary on ἐξ 1- 22 to ⁵ word adversus ,· the pars
Ambrosiana was discovered by Cardinal Angelo Mai, the
discoverer of most of the classica] palimpsests, in the
Ambrosian Library at Milan in 1814, and the pars
Vaticana in the Vatican Library at Rome somewhat
later 3 both parts were published by him in 1817. Un-
fortunately the text of this collection of Scholia is very
fragmentary and corrupt, but it has been of great service
in deciding the reading in ἐξ 20, 53, and 58.

The best edition is that of Orelli in Edit. Tur. Schol.
pars ii. pp. 252 sq., 1833.

ἓ 44. The Planciana was very little studied in the
Middle Ages even in the Renaissance times, and never
attained to the popularity of such speeches as the pro
Marcello and the pro Archia. But this fate it shared in
common with many other speeches. Niebuhr says even
Dante—as far as we can judge from his works—only
knew Cicero in his works de Finibus, Laelius, C'ato maior,
de Officiis and de Inventione. Of Cicero's speeches in the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries only the Catilinarian,
Philippics, part of the Verrines, and the de leye Manilia
were read. But when once the Planciana came into
notice it was studied very carefully indeed, especially the
text of it, and in the end of the eighteenth and beginning
of the nineteenth centuries there is hardly any Ciceronian
speech on which so much labour has been expended by
eminent textual critics, e.g. both Garatoni and Orelli
published separate works on the speech in addition to
their editions of Oicero's whole workS.
