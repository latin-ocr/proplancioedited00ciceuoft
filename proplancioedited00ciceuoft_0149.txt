28. vel quod. ‚ferendum refers to what follows, i. e.
the power not only of rejecting any one who was elected, but
also of condemning and ruining him (infra exitio).

29. tum enim gerebat. i. e. a man who had been elected
to a magistracy by vote of the people had to get his electiori
ratified before he actually entered upon his duties. This right
of the patrician senators to revise the decrees of the comitia
centuriata was limited in 339 13.c. by the Lem Publilia, which
compelled the senate to give this sanction before the measure was
voted on (Livy 8. 12. 15 ante initum snffrayium). In 286 B.c.
the Lem Moenia applied the same regulations to procedure at ·
elections. The formality of obtaining the consent of the
patricians rengainpd till the end of the Republic. Mommsen

5 1. exitio, ‘condemnation,’ opposed to salus. Cobet's
emendation of the manuscript exilio, which was probably due
to some scribe who knew just enough of Cicero to be aware
that allusions to his exile are frequent in his speeches.1f the
MS. reading is retained, we must suppose the penalty of ten
years' exile is referred to which was imposed by the Lem Tullia
de ambitu, and probably by the Lem Licinia de sodaliciis, cf.
Wunder. prol. 1ii. chap. 3 ξ 4.

3. ianua: metaphorical ; cf. pro Liq. 17 aditus, pro Cael. 26
introitus, pro Mur. 33 eam urbem . . Asiae ianuam. The mean-
ing is, ‘I have had to give up my conception of how the case
should be treated and do what you suggest, compare the personal
merits of the litigants.’ iannazpropositio‚ the decision as to
what are to be the main points argued in the case. Introd. §2-

5. offensionis tuae, ‘ without in the least incurring a
suspicion of wounding your feelings by what I say!

6. quod in discrimen adducas, ‘because you seem to me
to subject your merits to a test of a very ambiguous nature.'

IV. §9l. 8. tu ..tu . .·tu a good instance of anaphora
(ἀναφορά) or repetitio, the repetition of the same word at the
beginning of several clauses (κῶλα), a fiqura verborum of which
Cicero, as also Demosthenes, was very fond3 cf. Cic. Phil. 12.
