previous occasion during the games made capital out of the
religione ceremonias, especially the processione of state-cars with
the statues of gods on them, to stir up sympathy for his clients
by appeals to these divinities, or perhaps pointing out that it
was to the aediles that the public were indebted for this glorious
pageant ; Laterensis in bitter irony had said that he had done
his best to prevent the trial coming on during the Ludi ; Cicero
answers irony with irony that certainly the trial was taking
place during their celebration‚ but they were useless to him, as

Laterensis had betrayed his oratorical device and he could not ¹

now make any allusion to the gods in the procession ‘ sine tensis
quid potero dicere ?' A recent scholar (G. Rauschen) is, however,
of opinion that the Planciana was delivered before the pro
Scauro, i.e. before 2nd September 54 ; but this seems unlikely.

successfnl‚' ‘you scored a point,' the opposite of the phrase
