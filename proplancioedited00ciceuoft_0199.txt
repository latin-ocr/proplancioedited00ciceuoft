Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucanus ovicula, like
the preceding a distinguished general in the second Punic war,
was consul five times, and triumphed over the Ligurians and

5. honorum populi finis, ‘the furthest step of the high

¹ offices which the people gives ’ ; the genitive populi is dependent
l on honorum, a construction quite rare in Augustan Latin, and

apparently used only where the sense is quite clear ; for instances
cf. ad Fam. 7. 13 causa intermissionis litterarum, Phil. 2 ξ 48,
Livy 1. 38, Caes. B. G. 2. 17; cf. Madvig Lat. Gr. §288.

ν gives 910 consuls apart from the consules suffecti, supposing that
consuls had been elected every year. But in fifty-nine years for
various reasons there were no consuls, the supreme power being

quid potuerit etc., thus constituting a form of the rhetorical
figure revocatio.

9. L. Brutus : the first consul (244 Β. c.)

13. sunt . . consecuti: sunt is here trajected out of its

the subject of the sentence, and to avoid the ambiguity which
would arise from the juxtaposition of the three adjective forms
orti, innumerabiles, alii.

consul in 98 B.c., triumphed ex Hispania de Celtiberis in 93.
For C. Marius' triumphs over Jugurtha (104), Teutones and
Cimbrians (101 Β.ο.), vide ἕξ 26, 51. Cassius had asked ‘can
you show in Plancius' case military triumphs to justify his
election as in the case of the novi homines Didius and Marius 2'
