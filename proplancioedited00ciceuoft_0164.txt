:consilium etc.

24. non infuscata etc„ ‘ not tarnished by spite, always
free from insincerity‚ not counterfeit, without a touch of deceit,
not skilled in the tricks of hypocrisy—-as men so often are in

cf. pro Bab. Post. ξ 40 merces fallaces et fucosae.

§23 l. 7. genere: Cicero has just been comparing the
difference of the yenus of the municipia to which the litigants
belong, i. e. the different buizd, different type, especially as

‘conditi0n‚' ‘ nature.’
