INTRODUCTION lix

As instances of the status 1 definitionis, i.e. how is
the act to be classified and defined, we may take Demo-
sthenes in matiam, Isaeus de Cleon. herent.

532. II. Narratio (διήγησις) is the explanation of
the facts of the case to the judge or audience, Cic. part.
or. 9. 3 narratio est rerum explicatio, est quaedam
quasi sedes et fundamentum constituendae fidei ,· cf.
de Inv. 1. 19. 27, Quint. iv. 2. 30.

The narratio is not always necessary3 thus the case
may be purely legal, or the facts may have already been
sufficiently explained by previous speakers 3 Quint. iv. 24
plerique semper narrandum putaverunt: quod falsum
esse pluribus coarquitur. According to all rhetoricians
since Isocrates it must be (α) σαφής, lucida ; (β)
σύντομος, brevis ,· (γ) πιθανή, veri similis ,· Cornif. 1. 14
ut brevis, ut dilucida, ut veri similis sit. It will be
clear, if a careful consideration is given to τὰ περιστατικά,

’· circumstantia, i-.e. all which deals with the special

circumstances of the case, and by choice of correct ex-
pressions 3 short, if the orator plunges at once in medias
res, and keeps always to the point3 probable, if it con-

· tains nothing inconsistent or that disagrees with the

other facts of, or the nature of, the case, Dion. Halic. de
Demosth. 34, co'mif. 1. 9. 14, cic. de Im. 1. 20. 28,
Quint. iv. 2. 30. The kinds of διήγησις are many:
προδιήγησις, ἀντιὸιήγησ ς, ε’πιὸιήγησις etc. It may
contain also digressionS, excessus, excursus, παρεκβάσεις,
παρενθῆκαι, Quint. iv. 3.
