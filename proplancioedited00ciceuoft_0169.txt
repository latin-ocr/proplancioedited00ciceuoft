NOTES 81

XI. ἓ 27 1. 3. vitia, ‘failings,’ ‘short-eomings’3 vitium is
properly a flaw, a fault in the composition of anything.

vitia . . mirere, ‘any failings certainly in Plancius' char-
’ acter have been successfully screened‚ defended, by the facts I
have just mentioned ; (keep this in mind) so that you may
cease to be surprised that with such a career as I am going to talk
of he had so much to support him in his candidatum) A
troublesome sentence; two prominent ideas—vitia, which Cicero
tacitly admits3 in ea vita de qua dicam, which is really the
most emphatic part of the sentence. Cicero is refuting some
definite statement of Laterensis, who had probably said (α)
Plancius has vitia, (β) it is surprising that Plancius’ life gener-
ally should not be in his favour. To (a) Cicero replies, Plancius’
> short-comings are compensated by res eae, i.e. his kindness ; to
(β) that when Laterensis has heard the true account (ea is
emphatic) he will cease to be surprised.

4. potuerunt is a pure indicative3 all other editors, how-
ever, take it as = a potential 3 cf. Zonyum est ‘it would be ' etc.

ne . . mirere: there is an ellipse before this, ‘ I say this,’
‘I ask you to notice this’3 cf. Cic. de Fin. 2 ἓ 20 duae suut

ἰ enim res quoque, ue tu verba solum putes, i. e. res ideo dieo

nominatim ue . .‚ Cato Ma. ἕ 55 senectus est ‘natura loquacior
ue ab‘omnibus eam vitiis videar vindicare.

6. A. Torquato: in the year of Sulla’s death, 78 13.e.‚ he
was in command in Africa as propraetor.

9. contubernii necessitudo, ‘ the intimate sriendship aris-
ing from sharing the same quarters.' contubernium from con and
taberna ,⁰ the vowel a in tab is weakened by the accent on the
preceding syllable. In the vowel-weakening of post-tonic a
there are three stages, a -> u -> i (or u) ; in the case of con-
tubernium language never fulfilled its proper tendency, the
older form with u being retained by ‘ recomposition,' i.e. a sort
of scientific archaising which began about 20 B.C. owing to the

, introduction of grammatical studies from Greece. We expect
, contibernium, cf. incipio; similar old forms are nuncupo (³‘nomi-

 

cap-[i0])‚ occupo ,· cf. Stolz in Ι. Miiller Handbuch p. 27 O.

11. patruelis: T. Manlius Torquatus, one of the witnesses

in the case; an orator of some ability, trained in the same
school as Cicero, that of Molo at Rhodes, Brut. 70 ἓ 245.

15. in Creta: Saturninus and his relative Plancius served
in Crete from 69 to 67 Β. c. under Q. Metellus.

16. contubernalis: vide supra. contubernales or comites
was the term applied to young men of good birth who volun-
