60 CICERO'S ORATION FOR PLANOIUS

that there was also another· word conditio=wn-da-tio with
somewhat similar meaning, but the evidence is uncertain. Cf.
1Ιίἱέἶεῦογ Latin Lanquaqe p. 341, Athenaeum 22nd Feb. 1896

III. 8. aut te a Plancio
aut a te illum
Note the chiasmus ; in Ciceronian Latin chiasmus must be
regarded not as a mere occasional peculiarity, but as a ναῖε.

9. discedam ab, ‘I will leave,’ ‘pass over’3 cf. cum dis-
cesseris ab=‘with the exception of.' The rhetorical term for
this is praeteritio, παράλειψις : cf. mitto, non dico, ut non dicam,
ut amittam, quid loquor .? quid commemorem? etc.

10. contentione = comparatione.

illam: i.e. not a discussion of the general personal merits
of the candidates, but what were the points which weighed with
the electors for the aedileship.

§7 1. 11. quid? ‘whatl' ‘why !' a rhetorical formula of
transition.

14. per-raro: cf. note on ἓ 5.

iis magistratibus etc. : i.e. the tribunate of the plebs, the
praetorship, and the consulate.

16. diligentia: in salutando, royando et supplicando, Sylvius.

20. constituere, ‘ set up a claim to any personal distinction
which Plancius does not also possess.'

§8 1. 21. sed . . nunc: revocatio,
22. alio loco: ἐξ 19 seqq.

24. nec si: we should expect idcirco or propterea inserted,
‘nor does it follow that'; cf. Nat. Deor. 1. 9. 21 ‘non enim si
mundus nullus erat saecula ‘non erant, de Fato 12. 28 ‘nec si omne
enuntiatwm aut verum aut falsum est sequitur illico esse causas
immutabiles easque aeternas.

26. nam si, ‘for if this were the case, a jury would have a
privilege which the patricians in the time of our ancestors

superari.

sailed to maintain—the privilege of revising the results of ,

elections—or rather would have a power much more intolerable!

quod . . potuerunt is parenthetic‚ and refers to ut repre-
hensorcs . . essent, to which also id belongs.

patres = the patrician senators, Livy 1. 17. 9, Cic. Brut.
ἓ 55, de Rep. 2. 56. The decrees of the centurias had to be
confirmed by the patres ; cf. Niebuhr Hist. Rom. ii. p. 10,
Mommsen Hist. Rom. (Ε.Τ.) ii. chap. 1.
