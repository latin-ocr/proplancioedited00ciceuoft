lxviii CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

MSS. or 'PLANGIANA

ἓ 39. The text of this edition is in the main that of
Landgraf as given in his edition of Kopke's pro Plancio
published in 1888. He has followed the manuscript
reading where possible, has himself made a new and
careful recension of the leading MS. (T), and has incorpo-
rated in his text all the more recent contributions to the
critical elucidation of the speech}

The edition of Cicero's works by O. F. W. Miiller (in
the Bibliotheca Teubneriana) has been carefully com-
pared, and a list of variants from that edition is given in
the appendix.

ἓ 40. A brief notice of the chief manuscripts and

Evolution of editions is interesting as showing the evolu-

text. tion of a satisfactory text by careful work

of many hands from very corrupt beginnings, and is

typical of the history of the text of many of Cicero's
speeches.

Of manuscripts there are several, two good ones, the

manuscripts. rest classed as deteriores (dett.)

(l) The oldest is Τ, Codex Teqernseensis or Bavaricm,
now Monacensis (i.e. of Munich Ood. Lat.
187 87). Originally in the monastery of
Tegernsee in Bavaria, it was taken to Munich, whence it
disappeared at the time of the French invasion of Bavaria 3
