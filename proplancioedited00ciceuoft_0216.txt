128 CICERO'S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

Bithynia as if Laterensis had been there to study oratory, add-
ing, Ι thought he was going to say in Vaccaeis, i.e. among a
people utterly devoid of any knowledge of refined speaking-
a hit at Laterensis’ rough unpolished style. The objection to
this is that to give the jest point we must imagine that
Laterensis had been in some way connected with the Vaccaei
(a tribe of Hispania Tarraconensis, occupying country round
Zamora and Salamanca), but of any such relations we know
nothing. Niebuhr conjectured Barmis, i.e. from Barca near
Cyrene, where Laterensis held a military office *for some time.
For a joke on similar lines cf. Div. Q. anc. 539, ad Fam. 7.
2. A second explanation is to regard severus as the key-word.
Laterensis may have said that the life at Rhodes was minue
severa ; the Vaccaei are then quoted as a people whose life was
necessarily severa.

17. locus, ‘if the question of locality can give any handle
to criticism,’ cf. de Se‘n. ἓ 59.

19. causa: the reason of our respective sojourns.

20. Rhodi: it was here and in several Asiatic towns that1
Cicero studied under Menippus of Stratonicea, Xenocles of
Adramyttium, Aeschylus of Cnidus, Dionysius of Magnesia,
and especially Molo (probably the same as Apollonius mentioned
above) and Posidonius. Under Molo Cicero acquired his so-
called Rhodian style of oratory, i. e. a compromise between the
extravagant flamboyancy of the Asiatic writers and the bald
simplicity of the Attics3 cf. Brut. 316, pro Roscio, Landgraf’s
Introd. p. 120 f.

24. diligentia: ironica13 the scrupulousness which only
cgnsentls to defend the innocent betrays the inability to defend
t e gui ty.

causis ponderandis ε temporal ; we expect in causis ponde-
randis, very nearly the same as causis ponderatis, abl. abs. ; cf.
G. F. W. Miiller on de Off. 1. 5, the only other instance in Cicero,
qui nullis . . praeceptis trademiis philosophum se audeat dicere,
where he says ‘the ablative of the gerundive occurs twice in
Cicero used as an abl. abs.' In Livy and Tacitus the con-
struction is a little less uncommon3 in Caesar, Nepos, and
Sallust it does not occur.

l§85t l. 26. in Creta: Laterensis had probably served here
as ega e.

1. dictum aliquod, ‘that a good joke might have been
made on your candidature, but I missed it'3 the joke was a
pun on creta, chalk used to whiten the togas of candidati ,· cf.
