INTRODUCTION xxxvi i

The convener of comitia centuriata must necessarily have
imperium (i.e. be consul, praetor, dictator), it being
technically a military assembly 5 it is sometimes even
called exercitus, and its meetings had to 'take place
outside the city, most usually in the Campus Martius.

(2) The comitia tributa, or assembly of the tribes,l was
a produci: of the gradually increasing demo-
cratic tendencies of the Roman constitution,
and represented at first merely informal meetings held by
tribunes, By degrees, however, the comitia tributa was
systematised, and became the regular assembly for electing
the minor magistrateS, tribunes, aediles, quaestors (hence
comitia tribunicia,-aedilicia, quaestoria), and all officers
‘whose duty it was to superintend the various branches
of public administration, finanoe, justice, public security,
etc. 3 thus the people assembled in comitia tributa elected
the tribuni leyz'onum, the curatores navium? The
meetings of this assembly were usually held in the
Forum.

less prevented by unforeseen circumstances, Procedure at
were held in J uly or August, on a day ‘mmmm'

Comitia tributa.

¹ We must keep entirely distinct from the comitia tributa the
assemblies of the tribes under the presidency of the plebeian
magistrates (tribunes and plebeian aediles), i.e. the concilium plebis,
which was not an assembly of the whole people, as it was convened
by magistrates who could not summon patricians. Its resolutioris
were not, strictly speaking, loyes, but only plebi scita. Smith Dict.
