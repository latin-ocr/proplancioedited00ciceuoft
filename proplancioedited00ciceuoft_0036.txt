xxxii CICERO'S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

The question of what was meant by the crime of
sodalicium (illegal combination) and what were the
colleyia sodalicia is much more complicated. The
sodalicia‚ against which the lea· Licinia de sodaliciis
was directed, were associations of a purely political
character-electioneering clubs organised with the express
object of obtaining votes by bribery, intimidation, or
otherwise, and for the mutual defence and support of
members who might be impeached for such practices.
The law considered that a man was guilty of sodalicium

if any of the following charges could be proved against
him :—

(1) conscriptio tribulium, that he had joined an electioneering
club and enrolled members in it (conscribere).

(2) decuriatio tribulium, that he had divided the members
of a tribe into divisions, to facilitate unity of action in in-
fiuencing the election.

(3) pronuntiatio pecuniae, that he had promised them money,
which he had deposited with sequestres (trust-agents).

(4) discriptio populi, that he had divided other tribes into
districts.

(5) divisio pecuniae, that he had actually paid money to
votch.
