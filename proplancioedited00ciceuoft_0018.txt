xiv CICERO'S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

the lines of which followed his leoe Licinia de sodaliciis
of 54. Even in the previous year a senatus consultum had
been passed ut sodalitates decuriatique decederent lexque
de eis ferretur ut qui uon discesserint ea poena quae est
de vi tenerentur ,· but the disturbances coincident with the
election of Pompey and Crassus to the consulate prevented
it from being carried into effect. Crassus on entering
office brought forward and passed his own law de
sodaliciis. The rigorous penalties proposed by this law,
and the partiality which it shows for the accuser in these
cases of sodalicium, prove clearly to what an extent the
evil had grown, yet all legislation seemed powerless to
stop, or even to give a check to, the practices at which
it was aimed. It was the use of these electioneering
clubs (vide infra § 16) of which Plancius was accused.
Laterensis brought his charge under de sodaliciis, although
probably the case was really one of ambitus ,· he was
indueed to do this by the consideration that under de
sodaliciis the penalties were more severe, and the constitu·
tion of the court was more favourable to him as accuser.
ἓ 6. Under the lex Licinia the court was composed of
iudices editicii (i.e. a body of jurymen speci-
ally appointed), of which body the iudices
editi were those appointed (editi) to give their decision
on a particular case.1 The accuser had the right of
naming jurymen of equestrian rank, or tribuni aerarii?

Editicii.
