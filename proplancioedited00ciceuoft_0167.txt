n ro . .

5. ultro ε added to explain aliquid attulimus ; his exertions
were great, but he could do but little to affect the poll as
every one had already of his own accord given pledges of his
support. ultro=properly ‘beyond,' ‘further‚’ then in the
metaphorical sense of ‘beyond what is demanded,’ ‘unasked,’
‘spontaneously.’ It is probably an ablatival form, *ultrooh
cf. ult7·a=*ultracl; cf. uls ‘beyond‚’ filim, olle, Verg.‚ oloes

11. rogatio ipsa ε Cicero modestly attributes any assistance

’ he was able to give Plancius in his canvass not to his own

personal influence and the authority of his name, but to the

¹ necessitudinis coniuncta). rogatio: sifflnficatur petitio quae

facta sit pro candidato Schol. Ambros.

etc„ power of a superior 1n rank over an inferior.

Ἴ recurs at the end of his argument to these words as a sort of

² refrain, in order to impress on the jury the importance of his
