INTRODUCTION lxiii

μέθοδος κατὰ αὔξησιν, amplificatio·
ἀπαγωγὴ εἰς ἄτοπον, reductio ad absurdum.

But if the ἀντιθέσεις are &Qvi-ot, irrefutable in point
of fact, the orator must take refuge in deceit and
sophismS‚ eg. he may (α) abuse his opponent, (β) shift
the point, (γ) ignore the statements of the other side,
(δ) misstate the case etc.; instances of this procedure
are not uncommon in Demosthenes' speeches 3 cf.
Maximus περὶ ἄλύτων ἀντιθέσεων, Rhet. Gr. V. 577,
Quint. v. 13. The system of Topics is just the same as
in probatio, but the loci are of course employed to the
opposite purpose.

ξ 35. With regard to the scientific division of the
Planciana, Cicero himself probably regarded §g 4-100
(i.e. everything between exordium and peroration) as
aryumentatz'o or tractatio. The speech, however, divides
naturally, and has been divided by mediaeval rhetori-
cians, using the system inaugurated by Quintilian, into
4-58 tractatio proper, or arqumentatio (sometimes called
contentio = ἀγών), 58-100 refutatio

The tractatio contains an argument from probabile,
i.e. whose interests are involved—(a) ex causa, showing
that Plancius had no motive for bribery3 (β) eoe vita,
that such conduct is inconsistent with his character.
The latter question he goes into at some length. The
refutatio divides into rebutting the statements of Late-
rensis and Cassius the junior counsel‚ both of whom had
attacked not only Plancius but Cicero himself.

The following is the rhetorical abstract (with some
alterations) given by Olivetus :—
