ἓ 31. Ι. Exordium, προοίμιον, principium. The object
of the introduction is 1ο make the audience (α) well-dis-

posed, (β) attentive, (γ) docile; ἔργον προοιμίων, εὔνοια, ‚

πρόσεξις, εὐμάθεια (QuaeS. ap. Spengel i. p. 321, Quint.
iv. 1. 5, Cornifi 1. 4. 6, Cic. de [ην. 1. 15. 20 exordium
est oratio animum auditoris idonee comparans ad
reliquam dictionem ,· quod eveniet si eum benivolum,
attentum, docilem, confecerit, cf. Cic. Pop. 26. 97). Its
starting-point is the personality of either the orator, his
opponent, the judge, litigants etc„ or some thirty in-
volved, or both. Its extent varies with the difficulty
and importance of the subJect, and its ending must be
such as to provide an easy transition to the next division
of the speech, 1116 narratio ,· cf. Arist. Rhea iii. 14, Cic.
de Or. 2. 325. If the audience seem already prejudiced
against the speaker, either owing to 1116 nature of the
case (eg. in γένος παράδοξον) or by an opponent's speech,
1116 speaker is directed to make use of insinuatio, ἔφοδος,
a more indirect method of securing the goodwill of the
audience. Incorporated with the exordium we some-
times find propositio and partitio, the statement of the
subject and the division of the speech, both of them
factors, not subdivisions‚ of the Aristotelian πρόθεσις :¹
