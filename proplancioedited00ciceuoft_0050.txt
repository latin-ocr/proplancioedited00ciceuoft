xlvi CICERO'S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

sities of the Middle Ages, where the chairs of Rhetoric
were the most sought after, as part of the trivium
and quadrivium13 at Cambridge, where even in 1550
Aristotle, Quintilian, and Cicero were text-books—in all
these different spheres, in fact over all civilised Europe
for nearly twenty centuries, the study of Rhetoric is
closely woven into the culture-life of mankind. In
spite, too, of the exaggerated classification, elaborate
technique, the over-subtle refinements of rhetorical
systems, yet, inasmuch as the art of Rhetoric has ever

been based on experience and usage, a great many of its „

methods are useful for orators in any age.

ἓ 25. Thucydides talks of Pericles as λέγειν καὶ
πράσσειν δυνατώτατος (1. 139) of his con-
temporaries at Athens, but there is no
evidence of his having studied oratory as an art. For
the origin of Rhetoric as a science we must look to Sicily.

Rhetorie in Here it was that Empedocles distinguished

Si‘ffly· himself by the fiuency of his expression and
his skilful use of metaphors‚ so that Aristotle regards
him as the founder of Rhetoric 3 but of a system or art
there is no trace. It was a certain Corax (flor. 466)
and his pupil Teisias who first put together a τέχνη 01
hand-book of rules and directions for litigants with regard
to disposition and argumentation, and on which a theory
of eloquence was based. The need for such systematic
hand-books was caused by the frequent lawsuits insti-

History.

1 Ι11 the Middle Ages the sciences were divided into two courses,
trivium, i.e. grammar, logio, and rhetoric, and quadrivium, i.e.
music, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy.
