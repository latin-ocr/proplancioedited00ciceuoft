INTRODUCTION lxxv

§45 The pro Plancio was first printed at Rome in
1471 in the Ciceronis Orationes of Sweynheym and
Pannartz.

In 1498 the Editio Princepsl of Cicero's whole
works appeared, a reimpression by Minutianus of the
previous editions of separate works 3 for this no MSS.
were consulted (Dibdin Introd. p. 390). It was also
printed by Junta at Venice in 1534, under the super· p
vision of P. Victorius. The Aldine edition (Aldus
Manutius) did not come out till 1540, the text carefully
revised and annotated by Paulus Manutius, Under the
hands of various scholare, such as Lambinus, Graevius
(Greffe, Utrecht, 1700), Ernesti, all of whom edited
Cicero's works, a vast amount of notes critical and
exegetical, was accumulated, and these are the scholars

1 When, about 1450, printers from Germany began to settle in
Rome, Florence, Venice and elsewhere, classical and theological
works were printed in considerable numbers. One of the most
noted firms, the Manuzzi in Venice, founded by Aldus Manutius
(hence Aldine editions), published no less than twenty-eight first
editions of the classics3 these editiones principes or incunabula
were usually brought out by some eminent scholar, who might be,
as in the case of Paolo Manuzzio (Paulus Manutius, vide ἓ 45), the
publisher himself. Their value varies considerably in accordance
with the MSS. on which the editor based his edition; in cases
where he had access to a good MS. now lost, they are of course
'extremely valuable. Sometimes an editio princeps is the only
source of a text ; thus we have no MS. of Velleius Paterculus, the
codex Murbacensis, the only one existing at the beginning of the
sixteenth century, having been lost; we possess only the editio
princeps printed from it in 1520 by Beatus Rhenanus (Bilde v.
Rheinan).
