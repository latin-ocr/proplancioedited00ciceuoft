98* CICERO'S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

12. conficere suam tribum, ‘ to gain the votes of their
tribe ’ for their friends.

14. plena officii etc.‚ ‘for this is nothing more than
courtesy, attention, and a custom of the good old times.’

18. decuriatio etc.: vide Introd. ξ 16. These sections, 44-45,
contain one of the strongest points in Cicero’s defence. Later·
ensis had undoubtedly not acted in accordance with the spirit
of the law in bringing under the leqes de sodaliciis a case which
could only in reality belong to those de ambitu, and not nomi-
nating for the jury the tribes which Plancius was supposed to
have corrupted.

23. tum mirabor: i.e. if you prove these points.

armis: i.e. the iudices chosen from the tribes which were
said to have been bribed by Plancius.

25. non modoznon modo non, because the verb of the
second clause is the common predicate of both clauses, de Off.
3. 19. 77 talis vir non modo facere sed ne cogitare quidem
quidquam audebit.

illorum: i.e. tribulium iudicum.
ista: decuriasse, conscripsisse etc. Plancium.

§46 l. 27. rationem: in an objective sense, method of
conducting oneself‚ principle.

f 122513. hos : i.e. jurymen chosen from tribes who know nothing
o anolus

30. abs te z Lewis and Short state that this preposition has
in Latin the following forms, ap, af, ab (av), au-, d, ἄ ; aps, abs,
as-. The oldest form is ap, which was often reduced to d, ἅ ,· it
was also strengthened by the addition of -s (cf. ew, mox, vim).
From the first this strengthened form aps was used only before
the letters c, q, t, and was very soon changed into abs (as ap
into ab): abs choraqo Plaut. Pers. 1. 3. 79, abscondo, absque,
abstineo. The use of abs was confined almost exclusively to the “
combination abs te during the whole ante-classic period, and l
with Cicero till about 54 Β.0. After that time Cicero evidently l
hesitates between abs te and a te, but during the last five or six
years of his life a te became predominant in all his writings,
even in his letters. It was in September 54 that Cicero revised
and copied out his pro Plancio, ad Q. Fr. 3. 1 orationes
efflaqitatas pro Scauro et pro Plancio absolvi.

23 XIX. 4. cupidos sui, ‘many supporters who were men of
socia] influence.’ ,
