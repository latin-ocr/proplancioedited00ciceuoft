14³2 CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

to repress the right of public meeting oi· forining associations ;
political liberty kept reasserting itself, and the-sodalicia were
merely the sodalitates in a new form—a revival, not a new
institution. The sodalicia were distinct from other associations
in two points—(i.) they were entirely political3 their avowed

Ι object was to influence the elections by any methods, but

especially well-managed bribery, and to defend any member
who might be prosecuted for employing the methods they
enjoined3 (ii.) the sodalicia were more elaborately organised
than other associations; carefully systematised with divisions‚
subdivisions, and affiliated branches, they were an extremely
powerful and most mobile instrument in the hands of such
demagogues as Clodius. Such a highly-developed organism
extended its influence to all classes, but it was particularly
successful in introducing some sort of system and discipline
into the actions of the city rabble—the perniciosa sentina rei
publicae‚² as Cicero styles them—with the result that the
numerous riots and brawls of the time were often directly
attributable to the sodalicia.

of the constitution and methods of these sodalicia we have
considerable information in the ole Plancio. Cicero shows that
Plancius has not pursued various methods which we infer were
the ordinary methods of the sodalicia. .Members were duly
enrolled (conscribere) by the mayister collegii ; the whole body
of members was divided into decuriae, properly bodies of ten,
to facilitate the distribution of bribes. With this we may
