NOTES 89

order to obtain an audience of the senate, embassies found it
necessary to make large presents to the consuls, cf. ad Q. Fr.
2. 12. Granius’ saying is all the more caustic because Nasica’s
integrity was well known. The embassy here referred to was
that undertaken by Jugurtha’s son and two of his intimate
friends ; the answer they got was uti diebus X Italia decederent
Sall. Juy. 27 sq. To prevent this system of bribery, in the year
67 Β. c. a decree of the plebs was passed (the so-called lex Gabinia)
that the senate should devote the month of February exclusively
to the reception of embassies. The senate were also compelled
to give their award within ten days of the reception of the
envoys3 of. Cic. ad Q. Fr. 2. 11, 32; vide Mommsen Scaats-
recht iii. p. 1156.

auctiones, ‘public auctions ² ; these were held in the open or
in atria ammonaria, a spear being always planted in the ground
as the official sign of the auction. The articles were put up for
sale by the praeco, the money for them being paid to the amentarius
or clerk who attended him. The praecones received a commission
on the goods sold, hence Granius’ supposed disappointment.

20. M. Druso: M. Livius Drusus, tribune in 91 B.c., felt it
his duty to ‘ rise in revolt against the oppressive and disgraceful
political control which precluded any possibility of upright
administration, and to make a serious attempt at reform; he
was a man with whom the beautiful saying that nobility
constitutes obligations was and continued to be the rule of his
lifes Mommsen. His proposals for reform were, however, ²
annulled by the great capitalists‚ and Drusus himself was
murdered3 cf. Mommsen Rom. Hist. iii. 224 ‘The Attempt of
Drusus at Reform.'

22. quid agis? may have two meanings according to the
accent3 Drusus meant ‘how do you d02’ Granius meant
‘what are you doingZ’ ‘what have you got on hand nowt'

alluding to his political schemas (magma molientem); cf. Hor.
Od. 1. 14 0 quid agis?

23. L. Crassi: L. Licinius Crassus, consul with Scaevola
the pontifex in 95 B.c., was instrumental in passing the lex
Mucia for the expulsion of aliens from Rome. Best known as
an orat0r3 Cicero makes him the leading speaker in the de
Oratore, cf. de Or. 3 ἐξ 1-8, de Off. 2 ἓ 57.

Marcus Antonius, the grandfather of Mark Antony the
triumvir, was praetor of Cilicia in 104, where he distinguished
himself in the operations against the pirates. A staunch
adherent of the Optimates, he was put to death by Marius and
Cinna in 87 B.c. As an orator Cicero always speaks of him in
