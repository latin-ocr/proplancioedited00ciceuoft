infamia or iynominia 1 and consequently lost their votes,
but in the case of iynominia they might regain their votes.
ἓ 19. Comitia—The comitia, or meetings of the
electoral bodieS, were of two sorts 2—comitia centuriata
and comitia tributa.
(1) The comitia centuriata, or meetings by centurias,
Comitia were instituted by Servius Tullius, and must
centuriata. originally have been of a purely military
nature, with divisions according to property 3 this military
and timocratic character persisted for some time, but by
degrees disappeared and was merged in the democratic
tendencies of a later age.3
The function of the comitia centuriata was to elect the
more important magistrates, consulS, praetors, and censors
——hence the terms comitia consularia, praetoria, censoria.

1 infamiazloss of civil rights for life, a punishment for crime ;
iynominia=censure of the censors, nota censoria, loss of rights
probably for a lustrum, or five yearS.

² The comitia curiata, a purely patrician assemb1y‚ met only to
perform such formalities as conferring imperium on a king, or
deciding questions of peace or war, and cannot be regarded as a
genuine assembly of the Roman people.

3 This change is usually supposed to have taken place about
260 B.c. 3 at any rate the comitia were reconstituted on a fairer
basis. The thirty-five tribes were divided into five classes, and each
class into two centuries, one of iuniores, the other of seniores ,-
eighteen centuries of knights were added, and five of fabri, prole-
tarii, and cornicines, All classes had an equal number of centuries,
and calculating the votes by centuries it follows that every class
had an equal number of votes—a marked contrast to the procedure
instituted by Servius Tullius. The undue influence of the wealthy
classes was thus minimised. Cf. Bonino pro Pl. Introd. xi„ Livy
