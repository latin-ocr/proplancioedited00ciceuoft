126 CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

‘syntactical contamination.’ 'The writer might say (1) quod
yratum . . esse dicit, an ordinary causal sentence3 (2) quod
nimium oratus sit, virtually suboblique. The two expressions
are contaminated, with as result the sentence in the text; cf.
Cicero's literas quas misisse diceret recitavit from (1) quas
misisse dicebat, (2) quas misisset ; cf. Verr. 3 ἓ 134, de Off. 1.
13. 40, Verr. 2 ἐξ 36, 113, de Fin. 1. 7. 24, Brut. ἕ 276 etc.
This principle of syntactical contamination—‘the process by
which two synonymous forms of expression force themselves
simultaneously into consciousness so that neither of the two

—is of very wide infiuence in every language, cf. Plato τόδε, ὡς
οἶμαι, ἀναγκαιότατον εἶναι, Shakespeare Romeo and Juliet i. 5.

him‚’ from ‘Iam friendly ’and ‘we are friends' ; poenarumsolve‘ndi
tempus Lucr., from poenas solvendi and poenarum solvendarum
etc. etc. Of. on the whole subject Paul Principlesof Lanyuaye

25. nec nocentes etc.: Laterensis had said ‘Cicero only
shows thanks to those who need his aid in the law-courts ; the
only people who need such aid are nocentes or litiqiosi .· so you
gentlemen of the jury can neglect Cicero's thanks as you are
not nocentes or ZiMqiosi, and so will never give him the
opportunity os showing thanks.'
