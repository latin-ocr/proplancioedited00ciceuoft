ANALYSIS OF THE SPEECH lxxxi

is quite groundless. He did not combine with another
candidate to deliberately prevent the election of a third
candidate. Laterensis is wrong in stating that the

elected? if they had not both {ad a majority. More-
over, the Romans of old time would never have
ordained that the election should, if necessary, be
determined by lot had they not foreseen that equality
of votes was possible. Laterensis maintains that at
the first election Plotius had promised him the assist-

ance of the Aniene tribe, Plancius that of the ⁴

Terentine‚ but at the second election they had robbed
him of their support by bribery. This assertion is
inconsistent, for why should Plancius in the second
election, when he knew that he had the confidence of
the people, have grudged giving away the support of
the tribes which was now no longer needful to
him'.² Why, too, did not Laterensis charge Plotius
just as much as Plancius 2

55-58 What Laterensis has alleged about the sum of money
discovered in the Circus Flaminius, that it was to
have been used for bribes, could not be proved. The
suspetcted ddizss'sor was brought Ibeifz‘ore the consulb and

forward no facts; his proofs are unsound3 he wishes
to use his superior influence to crush Plancius, who
has unfortunately many opponents both in public
and private life. Cicero appeals to the jury not to
allow themselves to be prejudiced by idle rumours
about the defendant.

58-62 Cassius has asserted that Laterensis deserved to be pre-
ferred to Plancius because he was of noble birth.
Cicero replies that at Rome the road to office is open
to every citizen ; the only circumstance which makes
one man preferable to another in such matters is the
distinction with which he has fulfilled the duties of
those offices. ‘Has Plancius any brilliant military
exploits to bring forward on his own beha1f2 has he
