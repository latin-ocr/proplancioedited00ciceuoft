lxxxii CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

qualities which fit a man for office, but integrity,
common sense, and a blameless character.

63-67 Amongst Laterensis' claims to public favour, Cassius has

⁴ mentioned that he gave games at Praeneste ; but that
was the usual thing for a quaestor to do. If, however,
emphasis is laid on the fact that at Cyrene Laterensis
behaved with great liberality and fairness towards the
publicani and others, the jury should remember how
little is known in Rome of provincial affairs. Of this
Cicero cites an instance from his own public life, at
the same time showing how his experience taught him
a lesson which Laterensis ought to have learned too
-that to attain to office he must do his utmost to
gain popularity at Rome.

68-71 Further, Cassius has asserted that Plancius‘ services to

’ Cicero have been grossly exaggerated. Cicero owes
no more to Plancius than to any other true patriot.
Cicero admits that hc is under an obligation to all
patriots, but in the case of others circumstances have
not arisen which facilitate the discharge of the obliga-
tion ; however, in Plancius' case such an opportunity
has presented itself. Although many men who
merited Cicero's gratitude have been condemned in
the law-courts‚ that is no argument to prevent Cicero

in order to magnify Plancius' merits ; it was the con-
tinued implacable enmity of Cioero’s detractors which
made the magnanimity of his friend Plancius all the

71—74 Cicero—so Laterensis maintained—had invented these
obligations to Plancius merely to suit the occasion,
but, says Cicero, (1) is this likely? Men usually
conceal rather than make much of obligations; (2)
Laterensis had, himself asked Cicero to do his best
sor l'lancius3 and (3) two years ago Cicero, at a
time when there could be no question of temporis-
ing, in his speech before the senate had specially
mentioned Plancius as one of his most zealous sup-
porters.

75-76 Laterensis has chosen to mention Cicero’s defence of
Cispius, in which he says all his pathetic and tearsul
appeals were of no avail to gain an acquittal. Cicero
shows that it was at Laterensis’ special request that
he undertook Cispius’ defence, and that Laterensis
