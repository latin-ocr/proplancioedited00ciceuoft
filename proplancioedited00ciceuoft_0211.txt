ξ ’76 1. 23. lacrimulam: used ironically of forced team,
‘ crocodile’s tears‚’ krokoffissthrttne, laqrime di coccodrz‘llo. Late-
rensis had scoffed at Cicero's pathetic perorations‚ of which he
was so proud, vide Orat. cc. 37, 38, and for which Quintilian
criticises him. Cicero replies to Laterensis that his tears were
genuine, not due to mere rhetorical artifice.

24. verbi, ‘your expression? Cicero objects‚ firstly‚ because
they were not ‘little tears‚' secondly, because the diminutive

XXXII. ἕ 771. 11. L. Racilius was plebeian tribune in 57 B.c.
with Plancius, entering on his office lOth December of that year.
In 56 B.c. he exerted himself in the interests of Cicero and the
senatorial party against Clodius, who, when aceused by Milo de
vi, became a candidate for the aedileship of 56 Rc. in order to
make himself sacrosanct and avoid the charge. The matter
was discussed in the senate and promised to be decided against
Clodius, against whom both Racilius and Cicero spoke in
denunciatory terms. Clodius' hired ruffians thereupon raised
such a tumult that the senate broke up in confusion. Late·
rensis had mentioned Racilius in order to depreciate the services
of Plancius, who certainly during his tribunate had not exerted
himself so strenuously on Cicero's behalf as Racilius 3 although
Cicero ad Q. Fr. 2. 1 says Plancius totus ‘noster est, having

previously remarked de tribunis plebis Zonqe optimum Racilium
habemus. Cf. ad Q. Fr. 2. 6.
