82 CICERO'S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

tarily attached themselves to the staff (cohors praetoria) of some
distinguished general in order to acquire military experience.
The custom was transferred to civil life, and it was customary
for young men to joiffthe suite of a prominent politician to
learn politice from him, and sometimes act as his private
secretary; thus L. Gellius was contubernalis of C. Carbo when
consu13 cf. Brut. ξ 105, pro Cael. §73-

19. 0. Sacerdos in 68 B.c. became Q. Metellus’ Zeqatus in
Crete. In 74 B.c. he had preceded Verres as praetor of Sicily.

20. L. Flaccus was also Metellus’ Zeqatus (pro Flaec. c. 3). .
He was defended by Cicero in 59 B.c. on a charge de repetundis, Α
extortion in his province. In the year of Cicero’s consulship, ·

63 B.c., he was praetor, and ‘was instrumental in the arrest of
the ambassadors of the Allobroges.

21. adsiduitate ι cf. adsident below ; adsidere is properly to :¹

sit beside, then to be present in court as advocatus, a friend 2
who is present to support the accused and influence the Jury in ·

his favour.

ξ 28 1. 22. in Macedonia: where Plancius was quaestor
under the Lucius Apuleius mentioned below 3 cf. Introd. § 13.

30. in parentum loco: cf. Div. in anc. ἓ 61 accepimus
praetorem quaestori parentis loco esse oportere. The quaestorship
being the first step in a political career, it was considered im-
portant that the young quaestors should be directed by the
praetors of the province in which they exercised their office of
paymaster.

2. isti: the tribunes of the year 57 B.c.‚ eight of whom had
been in favour of Cicero’s recall, the remaining two opposing it.
We must suppose that Laterensis had praised the activity of
the tribunes of 57 B.c. in order to depreciate what Plancius had
done as tribune in the following year, since vehemens can apply
only to Milo and P. Sextius, not to the other tribunes.

XII. ξ 29 l. 5. scaena: scaena is the correct spelling,
although the word=Gk. σκηνή. The Romans, feeling that the
Greek η was a more open sound than the ordinary Latin e,
made use of the ae, which was a feature of country dialects ; cf.
the ‘ rustic ’ ο for more refined Latin au in plostrum—plaustrum,
Florus-Plautus, loreola (Cic. Epist.)-—Zaureola, Clodius—Clau-
dias. Similarly the Celtic reda became in Latin raeda, cf. Stolz
Lat. Grani. p. 271. in scaena, ‘before all men’s eyes'3 for
the metaphor cf. Cic. de Or. 3 ξ 162 quamvis &haemon in ;
scaenam ut dicitur attulerit Ennius, the ut dieitur showing it
to be a proverbial expression. Cf. Hor. Sat. 2. 1. 71 a volyo et
