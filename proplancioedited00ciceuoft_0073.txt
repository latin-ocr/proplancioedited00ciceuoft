INTRODUCTION lxix

in 1853 it was rediscovered by Baiter, who bought it in
Paris from a bookseller who had received it from Hungary.
The German scholar G. O. Harless (Erlangen 177 QXffrst
collated it before its disappearance, and communicated
his results to Garatoni, librarian of the Barberini library
at Rome, for his edition of the Planciana, published at
Bologna in 1815. It has been newly collated for this
speech by Landgraf. The MS. dates from the eleventh
century.

ξ 41. (2) E, Codex Erfurtensis or Tkurinyicus
(Petri Suffridi), now Berolinensz's. Formerly
at Erfurt, then in the possession of Peter
Suffrid of Thuringen, hence Thurinyicus, afterwards of
Gruter (J an Gruytere, Heidelberg 1592), who by its aid
corrected several passages in Oicero’s speeches. Now at
Berlin, hence Berolinensis. Collated by Graevius (J. G'.
Greffe, Utrecht 1660) rather carelessly. Wunder made
a very exact study of it and devoted a special work
to it.1

The MS. is a parchment, large folio, written in double
columns in a clear hand, titles and initials in red, with
glosses 2 in the same hand.

² A gloss, γλῶσσα, is properly a strange or difficult word, and
a ’γλώσσημα was the explanation of it written over the word or
in the margin, but the term gloss is wrongly applied to the ex-
planation; it should be called a ‘glosseme.’ Early grammarians

. made lists of these γλῶσσαι or unusual words, hence our word

‘ glossary.’
