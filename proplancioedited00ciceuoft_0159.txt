small wooden cases somewhat in the form of temples (ξύλινα
ναΐδια, Polyb. 6. 533 armaria ‘wall-presses,’ Guhl and Koner
p. 466). The imaqines were accompanied with the tituli, or
names of distinction which the deceased had acquired, and the
tituli were connected in some way by lines or branches so as
to exhibit the pedigree (stemma) of the family. The imayines
were usually enclosed in their armaria, but on festival days
they were crowned with bay (laureatae) 3 they also formed part
of a solemn funeral procession.'—Smith Dia. Ant. p. 796.

11. etenim, =nam‚ namque, introduces the reason why there

are so few who support the nobility. There is an ellipse, ‘ for ·

to show you that these are so few, we will go into the matter.'

caput et fontem: frequent metaphor for ‘ fountain-head,’
a meaning which can also be given by either of the words
separately ; cf. de Or. 1. 42 ab illofonte et capite Socrate. caput
often combined with arx, Livy 28. 42 Hannibal ibi caput
arcemque belli huius esse; cf. Livy 26. 7. 3.

received the civitas cum suffrayio ; cf. Livy 6. 26. From 323
nc. to the end of the Republic the Tusculans voted in the
Papirian tribe, Livy 8. 37. Tusculum is thus an older
municipium than Caere (353 13.0.), although the latter is usually
regarded as a type of a municipium.

16. praefectura: an exact classification of the gradations
of Roman civitas is almost impossible. At the time of the
writing of this speech we may roughly make the following
division of Roman towns :—I. coloniae (colere), properly bodies
of settlers‚ either Roman or Latin, sent out to occupy and
cultivate land gained in war, and thus keep in check the
subject population of Italy, and occupy that part of their
territory of which they had been deprived for their resistance
to Rome. coloniae possessed a regular government modelled
on that of Rome; their senators were decuriones, their consuls
duumviri; their laws and sacred ritual were the same as at
Rome, and the inhabitants enjoyed all the privileges of civitas
Romana. ΙΙ. municipia: municipes (munia, capio) were properly

‹ the inhabitants either of those towns in the immediate vicin-

ity of Rome who were removed to Rome when their homes
were captured and destroyed, or of those which concluded a
