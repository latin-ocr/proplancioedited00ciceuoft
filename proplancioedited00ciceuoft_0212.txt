124 CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

17. atque utinam etc„ '‘1 only wish that the Roman
pegpled haid tbeen ΙίΠοννεῗ by 1theh'furbulent {golencehofhcertaffi
ἰῖἑ ἒῖἰ ζῗοίοὲιῑΐὲ ἓξέιῗέἓῖαὲξῖυᾶἓ ἳθᾜὲῗῖο ffi‘ssnwfss‘i· tm:
licuisset with populo Romano ; 690 antithetical to populo Romano ;
licuisset per as in per me licet etc.‚ ‘as far as Ι am concerned
you may‚' ‘ I'll not prevent you.’ Historical allusion uncertain,
probably to some candidature of Racilius, possibly in 55 B.c.,
which was unsuccessful owing to some riot at election time.

19. eadem contendit, ‘ exerted himself as strenuously in
my favour,' i.e. as Racilius did.

21. sed me etc., ‘but that Ι felt that I ought to be satis-
fied with Racilius' services to me ’3 i.e. Racilius in his tribunate
had done me such service that I felt Ι could not reasonably ask
him to do more for me afterwards ; he had done everything one
friend could expect from another.

§78 l. 23. mea causa, . . facturos, ‘espouse my cause’;
lit. ‘ act for my sake.’

quod. . . crimineris, ‘you reproaoh me with being grate·
ful,’ i.e. say that Ι need not be so grateful to Plancius.

41 1. in monimento Marii: i.e. in the temple of Honos and
Virtus, which was erected by Marius from the booty acquired
in the Cimbrian war. Here it was that the senate met to

debate on Cicero’s recall, cf. pro Sest. 116; the senatus consultum
is quoted in the same speech, ἕ 128.

2. uni Cn. Plancio= certainly not by name. The decree
thanked all the magistrates, consequently Plancius, who was

one of them, and the only one of them who had interested
himself on Cicero’s behalf.

6. atque haec cum vides etc. : the sense is ‘when you
see how grateful Ι am to Plancius, who you say had done me no
service, how grateful must I be to you, Laterensis, who have
undoubtedly been a true friend of mine ‘ss '

9. defugerem seems to suit Cicero’s meaning better than
defuqerim, which is the reading of the best MSS.

11. abhorret a virtute, ‘wretched is a word incompatible
with manly virtue! Book V. of the Tusculan Disfflhtations is
devoted to the axiom virtutem ad beate vivendum se ipsa esse
contentam; ef. Paradooea 2 ἓ 19. The Stoics especially held
that a man possessed of virtus—a combination of manliness ancl
righteousness—could not be miser.

12. exereitus, ‘worried,’ ‘harassed' ς cf. pro Mil. ξ 5 quid
nobis duobus . . maqis emarcidum.
