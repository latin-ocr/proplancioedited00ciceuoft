hgx CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

In Suffrid's time there were 298 pageS‚ but 95 of
these are now missing. The date of Ε is the fifteenth or
sixteenth century.

Ε is a corpus of Cicero's works drawn from very
different sources. Thus in one speech it may go back to
a good original, in another to a corrupt one. In the
case of the Planciana Τ and Ε seem both to be derived
from one original, which must have been it‘self corrupt.
It seems probable that in the ninth or tenth century
there existed a current recension of most of Cicero's
works into which readings were introduced by an intelli-
gent critic 3 where then we have no good MS. to appeal to,
conjecture must always be uncertain, and to this degree
all MSS. of Cicero must be regarded as untrustworthy.1

542. Wunder2 in his prolegomena to his edition of

Ι the speech mentions forty other MSS. of

petav-tores. the Planciana, which can be classified as

deteriores.
They are of very little use, their evidence being only

worth noting where Τ and Ε disagree3 they are for the
most part of Italian origin, and of Italian MSS. Baiter
said interpolatis codicibus Italicis nulla fides haberi potest.

Deteriores may roughly be divided into
(a) Older MSS, which form the raw material out of

which the fifteenth-century recension was made.
