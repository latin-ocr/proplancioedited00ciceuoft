1ὂο CICERO'S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

6. rationem redditurum, ‘render an account of‚’ a
metaphor from book-keeping.

XX. §49 l. 8. comitiis superioribus: i. e. the electione,
which in the consulship of Cn. Pompeius and Crassus (55 B.c.)
were postponed owing to disturbances ; cf. Introd. ξ 2.

10. consul: M. Lic. Crassus, who, as promoter of this very
lem Licinia de sodaliciis, would be least likely to pass over any
breach of his own law.

11. harum legum=huius Zeqis, i.e. Liciniae ; cf. Verr. 1
ἕ 109 loyes Atiniae Furiae, ad Att. 2. 18 Iuliae.

1ἷὶ comparandi: here used absolutely, ‘for making pre-
para ions.

15. diribitae tabellae, ‘the votes were sorted.’ tabellae is
not in the MSS. but is a conjecture of Wunder’s. The ordinary
procedure at a Roman election is thus described :—The tribes
were summoned one by one (vocatae) along the pontes into the
saepta, or enelosures‚ booths. Each voter, being provided with
a tablet (tabella), wrote the name of his candidate on it. The
tablets were sorted (diribitae), the result announced (renuntiare)
by a herald (praeco), and afterwards by the presiding magistrate.

17. ain’ tandem? ‘indeed 2' ‘what 2’ for ain=aisne cf.
satin = satisne, audin -- audisne.

praerogativa, ‘ the century first called upon to vote ’ ; this
precedence was decided by lot, and the vote of the centuria or
tribus praeroqativa usually decided the election, as from super-
stitious motives its example was followed usually by a majority
of the other centuries or tribes, cf. de Div. 1. 45 praeroqativam
‘maiores omen iustorum comitiorum esse voluerunt. cf. Livy

24. 7, 27. 6, 5. 18, 10. 22, 26. 22.

19. renuntiatus ε the proper spelling, not renunciatus ‚-
nuntius:*muntius=*noventius, possibly from an obsolete verb
novere, to make new.

consul prior, ‘the first of the two consuls,' ‘the senior
consuL' i.e. the one who obtained the greater number of votes,
cf. adPis. §2me . . aedilem priorem, praetorem primum populus
Romanus faciebat, pro Mur. ἓ 35 in praeturae petitione prior
renuntiatus est Servius.

20. in illum annum: the current year. Th. Mommsen
Staatsrecht iii. 398 note 1 suggests in alium annum, which is ve
plausible. Most MSS. read prior before eam, in which case we
must translate ‘no one bas as the first (of the two candidates)
gained' all the votes of the centuries without being appointed
