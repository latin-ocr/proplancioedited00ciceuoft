1‘04 CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

XXII. 23. magnum quendam, ‘ a very considerable sensa-
tion. ’ qualemn with an adjective often = ‘ quite,' ⁴ very‚' ‘ greatly‚’
cf. Gk. δή ras: it is almost equal to a superlative; cf. de Or.

24. ne aliquid. iurares ε the allusion is to the event narrated
in Suetonius Caes. 20 3 in 59 B.c., during his consulship, Julius
Caesar brought forward his lex Iulia ayraria de XXviris creandis
ad campum Stellatem aqi-nmque Campanum civibus dividendum,
quibus terni pluresne liberi essent. The candidates for the

25. de summa re publica, ‘about the most important

for a moment doubt that there has been coitio? why, it was
in combination with Plotius that Plancius carried the votes of
a majority of tribes.' The emphasis is on cum Plotio, as is
shown by the answer una. Laterensis’ first argument is this:
the tribes who voted for Plancius voted for Plotius, and vice
versa ; there must have been an agreement between the two

candidates, otherwise there could not have been such perfect ·

agreement in the voting; and as a matter of fact, although ἑ
Plancius had been certain of the votes of, 10 tribes, he would
