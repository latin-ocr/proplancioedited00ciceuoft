ΗΧ CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANGIUS

4. Will it be better not tomeet the charge directly, bnt,
avoiding a discussion of 13116 11161116 of the case, demand that it
should be discussed before some other tribunal, on other lines?
translatio (μετάληψις, παραγραφή).

Whatever the status, the line, ground of the case be
determined to be, the circumstances must be next con-
Sidered (περιστάσεις 01 περιστατικά, circumstantia) under
seven 1 heads—

1. The person, πρόσωπον, quis.

The fact, πρᾶξις, quid.

The time, χρόνος, quando.

. The place, τόπος, ubi.

The motive, αἰτία, cur.

The method, τρόπος, quomodo.

The facilities, ἀφορμαὶ ἔργων, quibus adminiculi-3.

Or in the line of the rhetoricians of the Middle Ages—

quis, quid, ubi, quibus auxiliis, cur, quomodo, quando.

Having studied the status and the circumstantia, the
orator must choose his topics (ἰοσί,2 τόποι) accordingly3
they may be drawn from the contents of the case (insiti
loci) or introduced (adscripti).

¹ So Hermagoras. These are given very variously by different
writers ; cf. Rhea. G‘r. iv. 150, Quint. 111. 5, Volkmann p. 649.
² Probab1y=proper1y the general localities from which proofs
can be drawn ; 01· possibly positions which all orators may take up
in common. The text-books gave very elaborate commonplaces,
which an orator was recommended to thoroughly master. loci
are divided by Fortunatian into—
Zoci ante rem a persona, α re‚·a causa.
in re = ξ α tempore, a loco, a modo.
circa ‘rem a materia.

post rem.
