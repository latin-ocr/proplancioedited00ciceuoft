xliv CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANGIUS

convivia abs te et ab amicis tuis concelebrentur et passim
et tributim (de petit. ἕ 44) 3 entertainments for the people
at the candidate's expense (‘ it was for these that the
aediles ransacked the world for-the gift of wild beasts and
the loan of works of art, that Caesar displayed gladiatore
in silver panoply, and that Scaurus invented his movable
theatres which, when the plays were over, were wheeled
round, spectators and all, so as to form an amphitheatre
for the exhibition of fighting ' 1). The assigning reserved
seats at these shows to members of the candidate's tribe
or influential electors generally, was a method of gaining
popularity which was especially affected by the aediles.
All these methods then of gaining votes were considered
legal 3 one other method needs special notice because it was
employed by the defendant in our case—Plancius.2 This
is coitio, or a coalition between two candidates to onst a
third candidate and if possible obtain an absolute majority
of the thirty-five tribeS, the two mutually contributing, as
it were, the votes of those tribes of whose support theywere
certain. The term for this was tribum concedere or con-
ferre. These coitiones were of a private nature 3 a notable
example is the formation of the so-called triumvirate 3 at
Lucca in 56 to oppose the candidature of L. Aemilius.
