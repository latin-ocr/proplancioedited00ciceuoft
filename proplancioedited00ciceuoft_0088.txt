lxxxiv CICERO'S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

services were really such as to demand from Cicero
that he should do his very best ‘co requite them3 he

’ gives a vivid picture of the pitiable friendless position
he was in when Plancius welcomed him in Macedonia.
Both the dangers and the services were real, and it
was ri ht that Cicero’s requital of them in this defence
shoul be real also.

101-4 mmmmm—111 the peroration Cicero appeals to the jury
and to C. Flavius, the presidin g judge, very pathetieally
not to send that Roman into exile who had been in-
strumental in preserving the life of 0110 of Rome's
greatest citizens—Cicero.
