tablets (tabellae), which were distributed before the poll
by diribitores and then deposited in baskets. Before the

Forum, in the Hortus Scipionisl if in the Campus Martius.
If the auspices were unfavourable the elections were

which had been ‘inaugurated‚' i.e. considered as a templum
(τέμενος) or auyuraculum, where spectio or auspice-taking was
allowed. Cf. Mommsen Staatsrecht i. 89, 109, ii. 9.
