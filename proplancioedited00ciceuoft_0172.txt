821 CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

as one stamps articles which belong to the house and are a
permanent possession with marks burned into them.' forensis
opposed to domesticus.

ΟΖ 18.ι ἱξιῗέῒὸαε inurere usually in a bad sense ‘ to brand‚' pro
aen . .

futtilis: the MSS. all read facilis, other emendations are
fallax, fraqilis. futtilis ‘this ccurting and complimenting
of the people is worthless.' If facilis is retained—and as the
codices are unanimous it should be retained if at all possible-
it must be translated either (1) ‘ easily given,’ ‘ costing nothing‚'
or (2) ⁴ volatile,' ‘shifting,’ a use unparalleled in Cicero, but cf.
Verg. Aen. 8. 310 faciles oculi ‘easily moving.'

20. 11011 excutitur: lit. ‘is not shaken out,' as a garment
is shaken out by the buyer, i.e. ‘ examined ' ; cf. Gk. ἐκσείειν.

11011 111 manus sumitur is unnecessarily bracketed by Land-
graf as a gloss (01· 9Zosseme)‚ an explanation of excutitur ; the
rhythm, however, of the sentence is in favour of its retention.

inferiorem quam te: according to the grammarians, e.g.
Zumpt ἓ 484, inferior and posterior only take the ablative of
comparison and are not used with quam. Instances, however,
are not uncommon, e.g. de Off. 1 ἕ 116 inferior quam pater.
Ernesti considers the whole passage interpolated.

23. generis . . nominis, ‘in some considerations—I mean
those of birth and name.' These genitives depend on rebus
and define or describe the res more closely. The genitive is
originally the case of connexion, a characteristic which is
capable of very varied extension, and the exact nature of which
depends on the context of each passage. Landgraf emends to
yenere et nomine, Orelli qeneris dico et nominis decore, Bak.
qeneris dieo et nominis commendatione. yenus = nobility of birth,
nomen=family renown, referring to the fact that both Later·
ensis’ father’s and mother’s family was of consular rank. dieo

‘I mean‚' cf. Gk. λέγω δέ.
aliis, ‘in other respects.’
24. societatum, ‘joint-stock companies,' ἓ 32.

1. iacis, ‘you let fall hints of . . ’ς cf. iacere probra, eon-
tumelias in aliquem.

non modo . . sed ne . . quidem instead of non modo
non . . sed ne . . quidem, because both clauses haveacommon
