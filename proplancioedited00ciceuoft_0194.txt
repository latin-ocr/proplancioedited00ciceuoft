“106 CICERO'S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

deliberately sacrificed their ‘own tribes in order to assist you
and your party.'

14. in angustum: an ambiguous expression of Laterensis’‚
which Cicero ridicules below, anqustias, restrictos.

quam convenit: ironical, cf. de Or. 2 ἓ 180 vide quam sim
deus in isto yenere.

16. iactura: deliberate sacrifice3 properly ‘a throwing
overboard,’ vide note on ἓ 6.

17. eosdem etc.‚ ‘whilst these same gentlemen, when they
now knew (from the first election) how strong they were,
should have shown themselves so sparing and niggardly.'

20. sed. tamen: sed breaks off, an'd returns to the line of
argument begun in et ais. tamen explains, ‘although you
brought Plotius under the same charge, yet it was Plancius
whom you brought to trial, who had not asked you to drop the
charge (as probably Plotius had).'

21. eum = PlanciuS.

22. adripere=in ius rapere ‘to bring to trial, but without
sufficient reason.'

23. testes: i.e. witnesses who stated that their tribe, the
Voltinian, had been bribed by Plancius.

25. acceperint: i.e. from Plancius. Laterensis maintains
that the majority in the Voltinian tribe had not voted for him.
The testimony, therefore, of this tribe is most valuable ; for the
fact that they did not vote for him shows that he had not
bribed them. Cicero, however, points out that their evidence
is worthless, for the majority voted for Plancius, either because
they were bribed by him, or because they wished unasked to
support him, in which case it is not likely they will give
evidence against their favourite unless bribed by his rival
Laterensis to do so.

28 ΧΧΙΙΙ. §55 l. 2. caluit: calere=mu2tis sermonibus pervul-
9aturn esse ‘was a burning topic of conversation)

in causa refrixit, ‘now in the trial all interest in it has
cooled down' ; cf. Q. Fr. 3. 2. 3 Scaurus refrixerat ‘no more
interest was shown in Sc.’

t 4. eductus, ‘ brought before the consuls,’ the legal technical
erm.

6. iactatum, ‘ ill-treated,' lit. jostled ; cf. §17 iactor in turba.

9. praeiudicii, ‘ record of a previous sentence,' not: Eng. s
‘prejudice‚' which is opinio praeiudicata. ¹
