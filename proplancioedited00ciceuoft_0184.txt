96 CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

editicii by which 125 knights and tribuni aerarii were to be
appointed as jurors by the accuser; of these the accused might
reject 75. This jury of 50 was to be increased by the addition
of 25 senators, the method of whose election 1s unknown.

29. referre, ‘register ' ; sc. in iudicum allmm.
§42 1. 5. doceo, ‘sh0w‚' ‘demonstrate,’ ‘prove.’

illud acerbum iudicium, ‘ that harsh method of conduct·
ing the case‚' governed by fecisses, and to be supplied with
quererer.

6. senatus . . populusque: with regard to the order of
the words Mommsen Siaaisrechi iii. p. 1255 states that under
the Republic, when decree of the people and decree of the senate
stood side by side, the former usually is placed first ; a reversal
of this order, as here, is caused by considerations of the
tempora] sequence ; cf. CIL. vi. 1319 senatus consulto populique
iussu. Similarly Augustus in the Monumentum Ancyranum
(3.1) anticipates the election of his son by senate and people,

’ because the senate first gave the order and the people then

made their choice.

7. observatas, ‘canvassed' :quas observantia Plancius cole-
bat ei amicos ‘retinebat ; cf. ἐξ 39, 45. observare is frequently
joined with colere, and sometimes has the sense of respecting,
revering3 cf. ad Fam. 9. 20 qui me quidem perofficiose et per-
amanter observant.

10. neque nunc multo secus existimo: i. e. ‘since you
have been unable to prove bribery‚ Ι think the result will
be much the same, i. e that my client will be acquitted'
(absolutus).

11. ignotis : unknown to Plancius, and also ignorant of the
charge brought against him ; cf. in tembr'is infra.

14. Voltinia . . iudices : supposed to be spoken by Later- “
ensis to explain why he had not nominated these tribes as those ³
from which the jury might be chosen.

16. immo vero: a stronger form of immo: ‘,nay ratherss
μὲν 0511.st has recently been suggested that immo was origin-
ally a verb, compounded from in and emo, *inimo (cf. adimo,
dirimo)= immo, with the meaning ‘I tak'e upon myself,' ‘1
essert)

17. tacitum: nullum tacitum testem haberet Laterensis si
tribus illas edidisset ; qaia nullus esset qui de Plaowii innocentia
non diceret testimonium Delph.
