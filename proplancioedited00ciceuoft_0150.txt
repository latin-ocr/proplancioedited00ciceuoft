tribunes (494 13.o.), whose ,assistants they originally were
(ὑπηρέται τῶν δημάρχων) ; these two aediles were plebeians. In
366 Β. c. two more were instituted, to be chosen from among the
patricians ; they were called aediles curules ,· but in a short time
the office was thrown open to plebeians (cf. Livy 7. 1. 6 prima
ut alternis annis eoe plebi fierent convenerat ,· postea promiscuum
suit). In 44 Rc. Caesar created two more aediles, aediles plebis
Ceriales ; under the Empire the number of aediles remained at
six, As long as the aediles were mere assistants to the tribunes
their duties were very various; by degrees, however, they
became stereotyped. The most important were 2—(1) cura
ludorum, the management of the state games, for which a
grant waS‘made by the government3 the deficit, which was
always large, the aediles paid themselves. They exercised a
censorship over all plays, and were responsible for the behaviour
of all actors ; cf. Plaut. Amph. prol.‚ Trin. 4. 2. 147, Uist. epit.,
Tac. Arm. 1. 77, Suet. Oct. 45, Tertull. in Marcion. 4. (2)
cura urbis—(a) cura operum publicorum, i. e. buildings public
and private, and the care of the streets, drains, etc. ; (b)
management of the markets, questions of weights and measures,
'prices (annona), etc. ; (c) management of funerals, the disposal
of the dead and the limiting of unnecessary expense; (d)
censorship of morals ; the aediles controlled lenones, meretrices,
the management of popinae, games of chance (alea), balnea;
they had also to take measures against the practice of witchcraft
and poisoning. Of. on the whole subject Mommsen Staatsr. 1.

This dius Fidius, ‘ god of faith,’ we are told by Varro (L. L. 10)

and Festus, is the same as Semo Sancus, a Sabine deity, father

of the Sabine hero Sabus, who is identified with Hercules. His

temple was near the Sanqualis porta ; in later times he was regarded ².

as synonymous with Ζεὺς πίστιος. This may probably be thus
interpreted 2-—In the Sabine territory there existed at an early
period a local cult of one Semo Sancus, whose chief attribute
was the giving of fertility to crops (cf. semen ; Semones, title of

Pales and Flora), but who was regarded also as presiding over , ‚

oaths and good saith generally. When the earlier Heracles
