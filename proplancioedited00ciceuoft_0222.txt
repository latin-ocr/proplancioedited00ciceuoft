ἓ 61 neque esse inconstantis puto sentent-iam· tanquam aliquod
naviyium . . em re publica moderari ‘to regulate my opinions
by the condition of the political weather.'

27. ego vero etc„ ‘all that I have learned, witnessed, or
read, all that has been put on record by the wisest and most
illustrious men, both in our state and in other political com-
munities‚ has taught me that the same man is not always to
defend the same opinions, but rather those which the position
of the state, the bias of the times, and the interests of peace
may require.’ For the sentiment cf. the extract in the preceding
note. ‘ Cicero was deficient not in honesty but in moral courage ;
much too of his inconsistency can be traced to his professional
habits as a pleader, which led him to introduce the licence of
the Forum into deliberative discussions and (however inexcus-
ably) even into his correspondence with his friends. . . Although
he was perfectly aware of what was philosophically upright . .
he was apt to fancy that the circumstances of his case con-

stituted it an exception to the broad principles of duty.'—
J. H. Newman.
