ANALYSIS OF THE SPEECH lxxix

12-13 The reasons for the action of the people in passing over
Laterensis are explained: 110 had been remiss in his
canvassing‚ and was absent from Rome at the timo
when his presence was imperatively necessary ; 110 had
also retired from his candidature for the tribunate in
the preceding year. ·

14-16 The question the jury have to consider is not why a
man has been elected, but whether it has been owing
to Zaryitio, bribery, for the electors are free agents, and
10 introduce a system of weighing a man’s rights or
pretensions to office would be contrary to the spirit of
the constitution.

17-19 A comparison of the persona] merits of Plancius and
Laterensis would be out of place, yet perhaps the
people were justified in choosing Plancius3 for if
Laterensis maintains that his opponent owed his
election 10 1113 high rank, he might make the samc
complaint against Plotius and Pedius, the other
candidates, who were also sons of Roman knights.
Some there must have been who valued Laterensis'
high rank, but the number of those who thought
otherwise was larger, and we must rest content with the
fact that it is 3ο.

19-21 Plancius was supported by his fellow-burgesses, his
neighbours, and the whole population of his native
district, the prefecture Atina ; whilst the municipium
of Tusculum, where Laterensis' family had long been
highly respected, never stirred a finger 011 1113 behalf.

22-24 The fact, too, that Plancius’ father had been a leading
member of a tax-farming cor oration (publicanorum
societas) had materially assiste his canvass.

25-26 Some influence, too, in Plancius' favour had been exer·
cised by Cicero himself, who, he states, had done his
utmost for him out of gratitude for his inestimable
kindness to him during his exile.

27-28 Plancius’ personal character and general worth made him
a fitting recipient of the office of aedile3 as a youth
he had gone to Africa with Aulus Torquatus, who
valued him highly3 under Qu. Metellus in Crete he
served with distinction ; in Macedonia he was military
tribune and then quaestor, when he won golden

in his dealings with his kinsfolk, he has always shown
himself a man of virtue and integrity.
