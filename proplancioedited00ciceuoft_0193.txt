NOTES 105

Plancius by his coalition obtained the votes of 20 tribes, and
thus both were elected. To this not very cogent argument Cicero
gives a deliberately obscure and hardly serious answer, ‘could
they have been elected together if they had not together got
the votes of the tribes'l’ cf. Bonino pro Plancio p. 51.

6. at nonnullas: Laterensis‘ second argument. ac=at enim,
Gk. ἀλλὰ. νὴ Δία, ‘oh, but I shall be told’3 the rhetorical
figure known as πρόληψις or occupatio, the anticipation of an
adversary’s argument. Had Laterensis been able to show that

in almost allos the tablets of one tribe the names of Plancius .

and Plotius appeared side by side, he would have had a proof
of some weight ; bnt as inspection of the tablets was not allowed,
he has to limit himself to arguing that such a coalition must
have taken place, because in some tribes Plancius and Plotius
appeared to have got about the same number of votes. This,
however, might have chanced to happen without any collusion
on the part of the candidates. Cicero replies to this that the
time-honoured principle of deciding by lot in election to the
aedileship implies that the possibility of candidates being equal
was contemplated. This is not really an answer to Laterensis'
argument, but is intentionally obscure. Laterensis laid stress,
not on the mere majority, but on the consideration that the
majority was made up by the same tribes. This sortitio
aedilicia was resorted to if there were several candidates, and
more than two, or two provided they were not at the head of
the poll, obtained an equal number of votes ; cf. the lem

go on to say that at the first election Plotius and Pedius handed
over to you the Aniensian tribe to which they belonged, whilst
Plancius handed over the Teretine ; but that now both Plotius
and Plancius ruthlessly withdrew those tribes in order that
they might not get into difficulties (by surrendering to a rival
votes which they needed themselves). But it is absolutely
inconsistent that these gentlemen (at the first election), before
they knew what the wishes of the populace were, should have
been as you allege even then in coalition, and should have
