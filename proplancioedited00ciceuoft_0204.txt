*116 CICERO'S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

adsiduitate, ‘ constant presence ' in the local and literal
sense, cf. adsidere ; here speciall of the constant attendance of
candidates in the assemblies an public places, as recommended
in Q. Cicero’s ‘Candidates' Handbook, ' the de petitione consulatus,
ch. 11 desiderat nomenclationem blanditiam adsiduitatem beniq-
nitatem etc. ; cf. pro Mur. ἓ 21, Verr. 1 ἓ 101.

5. qua, ‘by means of which.'

minima invidia, ‘ with the least amount of jealousy‚’ an
ablative of attendant circumstances (the old, sociative case).
The juxtaposition of the two ablatives qua and invidia not
agreeing is awkward and not usual in Cicero.

XXVIII. §68 1. 7. nam: implying that one point is dis-
posed of and the next is to be dealt with.

11. meo nomine, ‘on my account,’ because he had be-
friended me during my exile. ‘nomen used here with an
allusion to the use in mercantile language, ‘ debt,' literally the
name of the debtor entered in the creditor's ledger, tabulae
accepti et impensi, then a bond, note etc. ; cf. Ascon. ad Cic.
Verr. 2. 1. 10 ἓ 28.

13. conturbare: sc. rationes, used properly of a fraudulent
bankrupt who deliberately throws his accounts into confusion ;
then simply to become bankrupt, just as decoquere, foro cedere,
or solvendo non esse. Trans. ‘ought I to refuse to meet my
obligations, or settle with all my other creditors in order as
their claims become due, and discharge this pressing debt now
when application is made for payment ’.θ’

14. hoc nomen, quod. urget, ‘ this pressing debt.'

dissolvere nomen, ‘to discharge the debt,' properly to
annul, abolish.

15. quamquam ε a mere rhetorical particle used adverbially,
‘yet‚' ‘however,' making a slight correction3 cf. Verg. Aen.
5. 195 quamquam o ! sed superent etc.

dissimilis etc. ε Gicero's meaning is that in paying a money ι’

debt the debtor parts with what he repays, but a man who
repays a debt of gratitude still retains the feeling, and by re·
taining the gratitude repays the debt. The relations of a debt
of money and a debt of gratitude are inverse. For a similar
play on words vide de Off. 2 ἓ 69. For a criticism of the whole
sentiment, which is probably drawn from a rhetorical common-
place book, cf. Antonius Julianus (a late rhetorician of uncertain

date) in Aul. Gell. N. H. 1. 4. He shows that debere pecuniam ³

and habere qratiam do not exactly correspond 3 this correspond·
