26 2. Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio: consul in
138 Β.ο. with D. J unius Brutus, was instrumental in causing
the murder of Tiberius Gracchus, and it is on this account that
Cicero says he knew neminem fortiorem. Cicero describes him
in Brut. ἓ 108, dc Off. 1 ἓ 109 as omnibus in rebus vehemens and
acer in dicendo, also ‘nullam comitatem habuisse in dicendo.
After Gracchus' death he was nominally banished by the senate
to Pergamum (pro Fl. ἓ 75), in the neighbourhood of which

6. Cn. Octavius: Cn. f. Cn., consul in 87 Β.0. with L.
Cornelius Cinna. After Sulla's departure to take the command
against Mithradates, Octavius was the leading representative
of the Optimate party in their struggle against Marius and
Cinna; by his efforts Cinna was temporarily banished; he

in such force that Octavius saw resistance to be useless; un-
willing to leave Rome, although he knew that death awaited
him, he proceeded in state, surrounded by his friends, to the
Janiculum3 here Cinna and his soldiers threw him from his
curule chair, cut off his head, and set it up on the rostra; cf. Ι
Tusa. 5 ἕ 55, Livy Ep. 80, Valer. Max. 1. 6. 10 for an account ·
of this bellum Octavianum and the massacres which took place
in it.

in chronological order, the person meant is M. Tullius Becula,
consul in 81 B.c. (cf. de leq. αρν. 11 ἕ 35). ¹
