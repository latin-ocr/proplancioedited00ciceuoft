DE SODALICIIS

As stated above (ἓ 14), the growth of corrupt practices in the
elections at Rome had reached most alarming dimensions.
Legislation was continually being directed against it, now
against one method, now against another, but the evil still
continued unchecked. One of the special forms of corruption
(ambitus, cf. ἓ 15) which the laws attacked was the sodalicia,
or colleqia sedaliam, illegal combinations or meetings of citizens
in order to influence the elections. The employment of these
sodalicia was the crime with which Plancius was charged under
the Zeae Licinia de sodaliciis.

The right of public meeting at Rome was in the earliest
times quite free from restrictions‚ and this free-
dom may be considered to be as old as Rome
itself, and, in fact, a characteristic of the Latin races. Numa
is especially mentioned as having instituted various sacerdotal
colleqia and uilds of handicraftsmen‚ who held meetings
regularly3 and the Feriae Latinae were the most notable out-
come of this Latin federal spirit.1 This was originally a
panegyris of the Latin race, convened on the Alban mount, to
worship Jupiter Latiaris and deliberate on matters which
affected the confederacy. In the earlier times of
the Republic the right of public meeting was
allowed to burgesses, but was limited by the
administrative, the magistrates, with the approval of the senate,
imposing any restrictione they thought fit. Thus in 186 ΒΛ).
the consuls and senate in the senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus
forbade the meetings of the Bacchic guilds without referring the
matter to the main body of citizens32 but later on, e.g. in

History.

Under early
Republic.
