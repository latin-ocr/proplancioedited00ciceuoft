NOTES 101

consul. The argument is this: if the vote of the comitia
praerogativa has so much importance in the electiori of consuls,
it is small wonder that Plancius gained immense assistance
from it in his election as curule aedile, when the whole comitia
voted for him.

23. praerogativa, ‘were a favourable omen of his victory ’ ;
cf. ad Fam. 15. 5. 2 quod si triumphi praeroqativam putas
supplicationem, Livy 3. 51. 8. praeroqativa is probably here
a substantive. The comitia referred to are those begun in 55
B.c.,'but adjourned probably because of an obnuntiatio em le9e
Aelia et Fufia, or owing to a case of morbus comitialis, epilepsy ; ’
cf. Introd. 52.

, 25 ἓ 50 1. 6. si tibi gravitas etc. : spoken with a touch of irony.

Gkg· dossiderare: properly ‘to miss,’ ‘feel the want of‚’ cf.
. 7Γο ew.

lO. secundo: sc. loeo, which Cicero usually adds; cf.
Goerenz on Cic. de Leqy. 1. 13. 54.

12. denique introduces a general statement to conclude
Cicero’s series of maxims, = ‘ specially.'

13. testimonium, ‘ token of their esteem.’
ambitioni, ‘ in return for canvassing.’

XXI. §51 1. 16. illud: properly speaking superfluous, but
inserted to improve⁴ the sense-rhythm.

17. querella dolorque: hendiadys, ‘despondent complaints,
cf. ἓ 76 lacrimas et fletum ‘ bitter tears‚’ ἓ 93 memoria et qratia
‘ grateful remembrance,' ἓ 97 preces et vota ‘ earnest prayers.’

illis sapientissimis viris: 1. 6. your father and your
ancestors.

18. App. Claudius Pulcer: son of Caius Cl. Pulcer. During
his father’s life he failed to obtain the aedileship. Elected,
however, at a later date, he celebrated the Meyalesia with great
splendour‚ and allowed no slaves to take part in them (Cic.
de har. resp. ἓ 26). During the Marian troubles he attached
himself to the Optimate party and was banished. Consul in
79 B.c., he was afterwards governor of Macedonia, in which
province he died.

19. patre : this has been corrected by some editors to fratre.

20. civi: ablative‚ but six lines below eive. Cicero most
frequentlyuses civi, cf. classi, cuti, avi, canali, iqui, bili, imbri,
