140 CICERO'S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

64 13.G.‚ this senatorial right 'was questioned by the popular
party, and considerably limited.1 Under the
later Republic the right of forming associatione
and holding public meetings was still further
restricted. The senate had to assure themselves that the
associations were not calculated to disturb the common peace,
the places of meeting were fixed, and every assembly had to be
presided over by a magist1·ate.² ’-

Augustus’ laws may be said to have abolished the right of
association. In Italy, however, and the senatorial
provinces leave to hold meetings was sometimes
granted by the senate, e.g. symphoniaci qui sacris publicis
praesto suntss were allowed to meet e le9e Jalia ex auctoritate
Aaq. ludorum causa. By degrees, of course, this right of the
senate was transferred to the emperors, who, however, very
rarely made use of it, and did all they could to discourage
meetings of any sort, at any rate in Rome itself. Severus
(A. D. 300) was the first emperor to reverse this order of things,
and from his time onward no limitations of any kind were
imposed on meetings or associations. As Th. Mommsen ⁴² says,
when Rome lost its rule over the civilised world, then the right
of public meeting was restored to its citizens.

In classica] times the associations which exer-
cised the greatest influence on public matters
were of three kinds— -

(1) sodalitates,
(2) colleqia,
(3) sodalicia,

the members of all three being called sodales.

(1) The sodalitates were specially of a religious nature. Their

Sodalitat s members had special temples, special sacrificial
e. ceremonies, special banquets in honour of some
divinity‚ and in these respects may be compared to the brother-
hoods of modern Italy, formed ostensibly in honour of some
special patron saint,5 whose name they bear. Oat0⁶ thus talks
of sodales, primam habui semper sodales. sodalitates autem me
quaestore constitutae sunt sacris Idaeis maqnis Matris acceptis.

The members of the same sodalitas were under special obliga-
tions, which were handed on from father to son. Thus one
