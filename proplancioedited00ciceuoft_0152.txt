651 CICERO’S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

2. qiud debeant etc. : the main principle of Roman elections,
‘merit' overridden by ‘ favour' ; ‘each man who votes considers
more frequently what claims the candidate has on him, than
what claims he has on the commonwealth‚’ and to gain this
‘favour’ was tho first business of a candidate3 cf. Strachan-
Davidson Cicero p. 94.

§11 1. 6. iudicavit . . debuit . . 'feroz the supposed
answers of Laterensis.

8. condicio, ‘position‚’ ‘ privilege,' ‘right,' rather a rare
use. The fundamental meaning is ‘agreementss ad Fam. 6. 3.
2 armis aut condicione positis aut defetiyatione abiectis, with
subdivisions: (1) a proposed agreement, terms, negotiations,
ad Aa. 7. 13. 2 condicionum tempus amissum est ; (2) claim based
on an agreement, task, situation3 (3) position which results
from the agreement, condition, prerogative ; cf. Nagels. §64.

11. nostrum est autem, nostrum ι this effective repetition
of a word asyndetically was classified by the ancient rhetorieians
as a variety of ἀνα. δίπλωσις, conduplicata, iteratio ; for genuine
ἀναδίπλωσις cf. Sappho Fray. 109 παρθενία, παρθενία ποῖ με
λιποῖσ’ ἀποίχῃ ; Hor. Od. 2. 141 eheu fuyaces Postume, Postume.
For the variety in the text, where a word or words are introduced
to give effect, cf. Dem. Ol. 4. 18 εἰσὶ γὰρ εἰσίν, Cic. pro Sulla 6.
20 suscepi, Torquate, suscepi etfeci libenter ; cf. Volkmann in I.
Miiller Handbu'ch. p. 666.

qui iactemur, ‘ since we are tossed,' hence subjunctive. For
the metaphor cf. Atticus ap. Nep. 6. 1 civilibus . . fluctibus . .
tentarentur, Cic. pro Sest. § 140 tempestas popularis, ib. ἓ 46 tern-
pestas seditionum, 5 101 periculi tempestas, pro Mil. ἓ 5 tempestas
et procellae in illis fluctibus contionum ,· so pro Sest. ξ 140, pro
Mur. ξ 35 urwlae comitiorum ,· cf. κλύδων Plato Le99. 6. 6, Dem.
de F. L. ἓ 136. Compare on the whole subject c. 20 of the pro
Sestio. In his metaphors from sea, storms, etc.‚ Cicero's favourite
words are tempestas, procella, tranquillum, fluctus ac turbines ; his
fondness for metaphors from shipwreek and navigation is
noticeable, e.g. naufraqium, yuberreare, syrtis, scopuli, iactura
etc.

ἕ 12 1. 15. defetigari: the spelling of T. The a of fatiqare
is changed to e by the influence of the accent on the preceding
syllable, which usually modifies the timbre of the vowel in the
succeeding syllable, cf. pati but perpeti, pacisci but depecisci ;
assimilation too possibly helps the change, cf. Stolz Lat. Gr.

16. venio iam: a formula of transitio; cf. elsewhere in
