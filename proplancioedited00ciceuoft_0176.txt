8‘8 CICERO'S ORATION FOR PLANCIUS

last-named title to distinguish him from Q. M. Scaevola Augur)
was consul in 95 B.c. with L. Licinius Crassus whose colleague
he was in all state offices except the tribunate and the censor-
ship. Distinguished for his eloquence, which Cicero speaks of
in the highest terms in Brut. 115, 163, de Or. 2 ξ 229, also for
his knowledge of law. He was the first lawyer to systematise
the Roman codes, the ius civile ,· cf. de Off. 1 ξ 116, de Or. 1 ἓ 180.
Cicero attended his responsiones, or formal statements of opinion
on legal points. In 99 B.c. he was praetor of Asia for nine
months, and distinguished himself by his unflinching justice
and his stern repression of the extortionate practices of the
publicani, in which he was well supported by his quaestor,
Rutilius Rufus, who was prosecuted by them in 92 Β. o„ and, in
spite of Scaevola's defenee, was condemned, probably owing to
the fact that at that time the jury-courts were almost entirely
in the hands of the equiteS. Scaevola met his death in the
battle of Sacriportus in 82 Β.ο. Cf. ad Aa. 9. 12. 15, de Nat.
Deor. 3 ἓ 80, Brut. §311‚ Vell. Pat. 2. 26.

15. et libere : Landgraf brackets these words on the ground
that they are weak after aspere et ferociter ,· but the MSS. all

XIV. 16. consuli etc. z the connexion is ‘ why should I
mention the outspoken remarks made by publicani and knights
to the aristocracy, when even an auctioneer was allowed to say
the rudest things to a consul unchallenged ’.ἱ ’

Nasicae : P. Corn. Scipio Nasica was consul in 111 B.c.
with L. Calp. Bestia. Cicero Brut. ἓ 128 says of him munes sale
facetiisque superabat.

Granius : an auctioneer noted for his humorous sayings and
caustic wit, cf. de Or. 2 ξ 244 Granio tne‘mo quidem dicacior ; cf.
Brut. ἓξ 160, 172, cte Or. 2 ἐξ 254 and 281.

17. iustitio (ius, sistere), ‘ a cessation of all public business.’
A iustitium, according to Mommsen Staatsrecht i. p. 263, implied
a cessation of private suits (differt vadimonia praetor J ην. 3. 213),
the closing of the treasury, aerarium, the postponing of all
public auctions, the prorogation of the sittings of 'the senate,
and generally the suspension os all public business, with the ex-
ception of those for the furtherance of which the iustitium had
especially been declared, e. g. in this case the levying of troops
